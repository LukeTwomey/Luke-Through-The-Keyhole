      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

had to visit while I was in New York. I had actually found myself passing through it previously when I was headed elsewhere in the city, but I made sure that day I was able to spend a decent amount of time there to soak up the atmosphere and get the required snaps. It’s every bit as frenetic as you would expect, and a great place for people watching as they go about their business. Some might call it spying, I call it observing. With a camera. And a big lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661732808/" title="IMG_0687 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8661732808_05cc479b64.jpg" alt="IMG_0687"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shine ya shoes guv?!...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660630625/" title="IMG_0707 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8660630625_db95ea58ba.jpg" alt="IMG_0707"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660629103/" title="IMG_0708 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8660629103_70e359ff33.jpg" alt="IMG_0708"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660627397/" title="IMG_0711 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8660627397_94220048f7.jpg" alt="IMG_0711"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660506123/" title="IMG_2484 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8660506123_3352d86bf5.jpg" alt="IMG_2484"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a busy boy myself that day though, and I was soon due to wander off to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, which was unfortunately undergoing restoration works at the time. I couldn’t get too many great shots, but here’s a few that I managed to take without any scaffolding in them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661735900/" title="IMG_0657 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8661735900_ee35fde177.jpg" alt="IMG_0657"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660633603/" title="IMG_0659 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8660633603_a8cdb9a7c1.jpg" alt="IMG_0659"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661737738/" title="IMG_0655 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8661737738_c2d18a973d.jpg" alt="IMG_0655"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing my busy schedule (the only way to get to see everything I wanted to while I was there!) I headed to a genuine Hollywood film set! Anyone seen “I Am Legend” with Will Smith? The bit where he hits golf balls towards the city skyline is filmed on a Blackbird jet on the Intrepid aircraft carrier - converted into a very cool museum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9358427416/" title="iamlegend26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7281/9358427416_81a92db421.jpg" alt="iamlegend26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661723766/" title="IMG_0733 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8661723766_4ea582a32e.jpg" alt="IMG_0733"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661722510/" title="IMG_0767 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8661722510_140305b439.jpg" alt="IMG_0767"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660618577/" title="IMG_0780 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8660618577_f9df7289f1.jpg" alt="IMG_0780"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660617115/" title="IMG_0795 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8660617115_8fa9a76438.jpg" alt="IMG_0795"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660615705/" title="IMG_0845 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8660615705_91ec729189.jpg" alt="IMG_0845"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660614229/" title="IMG_0856 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8660614229_3a984d2f7d.jpg" alt="IMG_0856"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660613085/" title="IMG_0864 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8660613085_902d3a3348.jpg" alt="IMG_0864"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately - again, due to Hurricane Sandy - the Enterprise space shuttle exhibit was closed for maintenance and repair. Apparently it did have a kind of tent covering it, which had collapsed and caused some damage. The silver lining was being able to get a nice side on shot without anything in the way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Hollywood film set beckoned - actually come to think of it, most places in New York probably are! - anyone who’s seen Night at the Museum will know the Museum of Natural History. What most people don’t know is, it’s actually based on a true story. Indeed, on more than one occasion I caught “inanimate” animals quickly turning their heads out of the corner of my eye as I walked past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660583639/" title="IMG_1009 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8660583639_f3808bd1af.jpg" alt="IMG_1009"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661690270/" title="IMG_0947 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8661690270_7ebbe9aaa9.jpg" alt="IMG_0947"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660587051/" title="IMG_0961 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8660587051_eedab16840.jpg" alt="IMG_0961"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660586381/" title="IMG_0969 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8660586381_36ab8e259d.jpg" alt="IMG_0969"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661685460/" title="IMG_0985 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8661685460_7680af7218.jpg" alt="IMG_0985"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661691498/" title="IMG_0916 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8661691498_19058cff43.jpg" alt="IMG_0916"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a city as crowded and densely populated as New York, any space is valuable. That’s why the repurposing of an old elevated railway line in the lower west side to green space was so clever. Apparently it took inspiration from a similar project in Paris. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Line is 1 mile long, and as you can imagine - being built where a railway line once ran, is not your average park. Judging by the number of people that were there when Amber, Emily and I visited, it’s a very popular addition to the area, especially on a nice sunny day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661660170/" title="IMG_1351 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8661660170_fd495a12e4.jpg" alt="IMG_1351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amber and Emily taking a stroll...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660557929/" title="IMG_1355 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8262/8660557929_3dbb2e1caf.jpg" alt="IMG_1355"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660556599/" title="IMG_1368 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8660556599_8a7b813781.jpg" alt="IMG_1368"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660554949/" title="IMG_1375 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8660554949_81d67dc5bb.jpg" alt="IMG_1375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning I had a slight problem. I was unable to withdraw any money from the ATM, and I was down to my last $30. Since I’d lost the card for the current account I’d opened specifically for my trip, back in Vietnam - I’d been using my credit card to withdraw money. Not only did that cost me a load more in fees, but once you reach a certain percentage of your credit limit, you are then unable to withdraw anymore. I’d already learnt this the hard way somewhere in Asia. I assumed this was what the problem was again, so logged in and juggled things around to pay off some of the balance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn’t work. The following day I was still unable to withdraw money (it should have cleared by then), so I was forced to phone the credit card company. It transpired that due to suspected fraudulent activity, they’d frozen my account. This, despite the fact I’d phoned them once before I left to inform them I’d be travelling abroad, and again somewhere in Asia where they’d done the same thing. The lesson to learn from this is - don’t be an idiot and leave your bank card in an ATM in Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having eventually been able to get my hands on some more cash, I continued on my sightseeing extravaganza. The name of the next building I was going to visit was an uncomfortable reminder of what I would soon be heading home to after so long doing absolutely no housework! The Flatiron building is so named because of its unusual shape in construction. Built where an avenue and a street converge, the iron shape is very unique and many people come to view the clever architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660548929/" title="IMG_1411 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8660548929_7f4889deb6.jpg" alt="IMG_1411"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not content with my previous clueless experience at an American sporting event, I’d booked a ticket that evening to go and see The New York Knicks play at Madison Square Garden. Once again, absolutely no idea of the rules whatsoever, but the scoring was far easier to understand than baseball! The atmosphere was fantastic, better than Yankee stadium in fact - possibly because it’s all enclosed. And the action is far more fast paced which made it more exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660544641/" title="IMG_1465 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8660544641_31838d04e5.jpg" alt="IMG_1465"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660543107/" title="IMG_1466 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8660543107_ce0bb0bb4d.jpg" alt="IMG_1466"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660541425/" title="IMG_1571 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8262/8660541425_45fa4bf124.jpg" alt="IMG_1571"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661635646/" title="IMG_1878 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8661635646_716c2517d2.jpg" alt="IMG_1878"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy dancers too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=9070282f48&amp;photo_id=8712400370&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=9070282f48&amp;photo_id=8712400370&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait... wrong video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=23513c5d0d&amp;photo_id=8714797602&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=23513c5d0d&amp;photo_id=8714797602&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660538821/" title="IMG_1661 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8660538821_7ef1a2972f.jpg" alt="IMG_1661"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English premier league is definitely missing a trick with its half time entertainment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course no trip to the Big Apple would be complete without a trip in a rather quick elevator (lift, for us British folk) to the top of a very tall skyscraper. You really have two options, Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Centre), or the Empire State Building. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Top of the Rock has the advantage of being able to see the iconic Empire State Building when you’re at the top. The Empire State Building, well... it’s the Empire State Building! I couldn’t decide between the two, so I did both. In fact, I did Rockefeller twice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I made my way there, I was looking upwards between the rows of tall buildings at clouds drawing in, and covering up the previously sunny sky. I could have delayed my visit, but the forecast for the next few days was no better. The sun I had been enjoying looked to be coming to an end. I made the decision to go up anyway, but wasn’t out on the top observation deck for long at all before the sky came over very dark, and the wind picked up enormously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660529341/" title="IMG_2052 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8660529341_9b29b0bfbb.jpg" alt="IMG_2052"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661628220/" title="IMG_2082 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8661628220_790da2f401.jpg" alt="IMG_2082"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made for very cool photos, but unfortunately it was short lived, as the staff came outside and rounded up all the tourists, closing the topmost observation deck in anticipation of the imminent bad weather. I didn’t have to wait for long. Within a few minutes, the skies opened and torrential rain began falling, forcing the last of the stragglers to run back inside. With no prospect of it stopping anytime soon, I made my way back down, disappointed... consoling myself with the smoky BBQ burger and milkshake I posted last time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absolutely did the trick, and apparently also had some freaky control over the weather too, as when I came out of the restaurant, the rain had stopped! With nothing else planned that night - as I had intended to hang around at the top for a while enjoying the view and going overboard with photos as I usually do - I decided I would pay to go up again. What the hell, I was only going to be there once... make the most of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeating the journey upwards, with a strong sense of deja vu, I emerged onto the observation deck again to see clouds and lightning in the distance. The camera was set up, and hundreds of photos later I managed to capture one I was really pleased with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660523699/" title="IMG_2165 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8262/8660523699_e8211d85c2.jpg" alt="IMG_2165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now libraries aren’t my territory usually... but i think you’ll agree this one isn’t your typical library, and was well worth a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661619302/" title="IMG_2223 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8661619302_2c3f5bfd0f.jpg" alt="IMG_2223"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661622238/" title="IMG_2208 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8661622238_b7af0e91d5.jpg" alt="IMG_2208"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660519983/" title="IMG_2221 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8660519983_3cd174b69c.jpg" alt="IMG_2221"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New York Public Library has over 75 miles of shelving and if I’m honest, is just a tad more impressive than Croydon Central. It’s a close run thing though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daddy was next. The Empire State Building is the first thing you think of when you think of New York City, and the views were incredible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660503575/" title="IMG_2642 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8660503575_09f3c7167f.jpg" alt="IMG_2642"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=24b274281a&amp;photo_id=8711414833&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=24b274281a&amp;photo_id=8711414833&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661601642/" title="IMG_2680 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8661601642_d81b7376a4.jpg" alt="IMG_2680"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661599850/" title="IMG_2737 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8661599850_bf64d9d9de.jpg" alt="IMG_2737"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660686781/" title="IMG_2743 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8660686781_0b820d89e8.jpg" alt="IMG_2743"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660497353/" title="IMG_2754 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8660497353_8c848dbdb6.jpg" alt="IMG_2754"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660496375/" title="IMG_2818 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8660496375_a42ce58173.jpg" alt="IMG_2818"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660493723/" title="IMG_2845 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8660493723_cf8c9dee95.jpg" alt="IMG_2845"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661593902/" title="IMG_2855 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8661593902_9922c3e9bc.jpg" alt="IMG_2855"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660492143/" title="IMG_2860 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8660492143_06d0683467.jpg" alt="IMG_2860"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s strange to view the city from this height, being so used to the hustle and bustle down on the streets below.

You also realise just how big the city actually is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at street level, I returned to Times Square for the obligatory night shots before returning home to drink with the girls, and get jumped on by King some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661608234/" title="IMG_2330 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8661608234_13ea0321d0.jpg" alt="IMG_2330"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661609616/" title="IMG_2326 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8661609616_413f25dd40.jpg" alt="IMG_2326"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=1d64715fbf&amp;photo_id=8711588149&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=1d64715fbf&amp;photo_id=8711588149&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My time in The City That Never Sleeps was drawing to a close.

My flight back to London landed at something unpleasant like 6 am. It was actually strange seeing my parents in real life, as opposed to the tiny Skype-sized faces I'd grown accustomed to. The weather was cold, and cloudy. My cat pretty much ignored me for a few hours, as if to punish me for leaving for so long. There was a niggling feeling in the back of my mind that I should be getting ready for my next coach, train or plane journey to my next stop, but there were no more places to visit... my once in a lifetime journey was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality slowly sunk in, and as I trawled through my photos I reminisced on the best year of my life. There were plenty of ups and a few downs - some more painful than others! - but zero regrets, and I'd do it all again in a heartbeat if I ever got the chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's all folks. I got there in the end... only three months late! If you stuck with it for this long, then wow - I'm impressed! A big thank you for joining me, and farewell......  until next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1422881625804810566/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/07/new-york-part-two.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1422881625804810566'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1422881625804810566'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/07/new-york-part-two.html' title='New York - Part Two'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-13007705979293469</id><published>2013-07-29T17:21:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-07-29T17:21:08.771+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New York'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='America'/><title type='text'>New York - Part One</title><content type='html'>40 minutes on the bus to Auckland airport, 3 and a half hours on the plane to Sydney, 13 and a half hours from Sydney to Los Angeles, 5 hours from LA to New York, 30 minutes on the wrong train doing a lap of the airport terminals, 45 minutes on the subway to Manhattan and the nearest T-Mobile store for my 3G SIM card (priorities!) and finally 40 minutes on the subway to Brooklyn and my couchsurfing hosts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after what felt like possibly the longest 24 hours of my life, I was in NEW YORK BABY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660502279/" title="IMG_2659 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8660502279_9e8513f28a.jpg" alt="IMG_2659"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subway train gave me my first real taste of the city. In a relatively short period of time, three different sellers peddling quality merchandise made their way through the carriages. One was selling various snacks for $1 - bargain (apparently). The following lady was selling chocolate bars. I was sensing a confectionary theme to the proceedings, but that was blown out of the water by the “Smell Good Man”! “I’ll make ya smell GOOD!” he loudly advertised. “Sometimes when ya turn a corner in this subway, it’ll blow ya HEAD OFF!”. I was learning a hell of a lot about the New York City population already... He concluded his act, and having made no sales of his homemade fragrances, trudged along to the next carriage to repeat the performance. I knew instantly I was going to love New York every bit as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660681943/" title="IMG_0156 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8660681943_46f8660805.jpg" alt="IMG_0156"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661652656/" title="IMG_1387 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8262/8661652656_f3d1d223f1.jpg" alt="IMG_1387"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when you fly from one country to another, and stupidly wear something that was completely acceptable at your departure point, but wildly inappropriate at your destination? Well, I did that. I received some strange looks on the subway, sitting there in shorts, flip flops, and my fleece thrown on for good measure. Thick coats and scarves were the order of the day, and after exiting the subway I could see why. I was absolutely freezing. After buying my SIM card I managed to pull some socks and my sandals out of my overloaded bag, and cover my frostbitten toes. I had trousers in there somewhere but there was no way I was going to pull everything out of my bag and repack it, and I had nowhere to change into them anyway. After a cold onward journey, I reached my hosts, Amber, Emily and King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661565180/" title="IMG_3127 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8661565180_b126124c0e.jpg" alt="IMG_3127"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661663776/" title="IMG_1316 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8661663776_8735edf399.jpg" alt="IMG_1316"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661662820/" title="IMG_1331 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/8661662820_2aa11f1617.jpg" alt="IMG_1331"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660561015/" title="IMG_1340 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8660561015_53fa386a74.jpg" alt="IMG_1340"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls were from Louisiana, Ohio, but had come to the city for an adventure and had been living and working there for nearly a year. King is their hyperactive, rescued pitbull. They were great fun, as you can see from the photos, which is just what I wanted, to end the year on a high note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber is a huge Game of Thrones fan, and there was an exhibition running while I was there, displaying the props/costumes etc. The following day after all of us woke a little late (I was catching up on much needed sleep and they were both off work that day), we made our way along there intending to check it out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funnily enough, on the subway there, after just talking about how great it is to see performers and musicians on the subway, at the very next stop a bunch of guys with bongos got on and yelled “good afternoon!” to the carriage. We were the only ones who replied! It reminded me of the tube in London where everybody is in their own little unresponsive bubble. They sat down and played and they got off at the same stop as us. After tipping them, we chat to them for a while and they said how surprised they were that people had said hello to them, until they found out we weren’t from New York and then they weren’t surprised at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="282" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=9b3567b0df&amp;photo_id=9348683615&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=9b3567b0df&amp;photo_id=9348683615&amp;hd_default=false" height="282" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After exiting the tube, we managed to find the exhibition, but the entrance queue stretched right the way to the corner of the block, and almost to the other corner as well. We didn’t want to wait around for that long, so quickly abandoned that idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brief glance over my “to see” list and the plan quickly changed to The Bronx Zoo. Amber phoned a friend who had a car and was already in the area, and we were soon driving over there to say hello to the animals. Brisk walking was key, as we had actually arrived fairly late in the day after waking late in the first place, and then our failed exhibition visit. We got to see most of the animals before closing though. Oh, hundreds of peacocks as well... if you have a strange peacock obsession, make your way to The Bronx Zoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9348439339/" title="IMG_0070 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/9348439339_9c98837f6b.jpg" alt="IMG_0070"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661793188/" title="IMG_0052 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8661793188_12d28b368d.jpg" alt="IMG_0052"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9351231312/" title="IMG_0036 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/9351231312_ca766b5c96.jpg" alt="IMG_0036"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9348442697/" title="IMG_0057 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/9348442697_5ac75f3dba.jpg" alt="IMG_0057"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9351226898/" title="IMG_0042 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/9351226898_ff66c8b3a5.jpg" alt="IMG_0042"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9348452903/" title="IMG_0033 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/9348452903_3edfc2ee70.jpg" alt="IMG_0033"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being forced out of the zoo due to its closing, we went to get dinner (pizza, naturally!), then a crepe covered in chocolate, fudge sauce and the like for dessert. I was remiss in not taking any photos here, but I made up for that during the rest of my visit. As they say in America, go hard or go home. As it turned out, I went hard, then went home about 10 stone heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661795280/" title="IMG_0096 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8661795280_1c88cc88f8.jpg" alt="IMG_0096"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Food trucks are AMAZING.

I’d nearly made it one year without needing them, but it was just too cold in New York! I went out and bought a cheap coat, hat, gloves, and plimsol type shoes - emphasis on cheap as I already had no money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting warm I hopped aboard the Staten Island ferry. I didn’t particularly want to go to Staten Island, but due to Hurricane Sandy, this was the cheapest (free!) way to get near to The Statue Of Liberty. The hurricane had damaged Ellis Island, where the statue stands, and it was closed for repairs for the foreseeable future. Disappointing for me, as I’d wanted to go up to the top of the statue, but a photo from the ferry would have to do! It also gave a nice view back across to Manhattan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660682877/" title="IMG_0132 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8660682877_615f69d848.jpg" alt="IMG_0132"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661785630/" title="IMG_0120 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8661785630_67ee92f3b4.jpg" alt="IMG_0120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660671001/" title="IMG_0241 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8660671001_138f50e54b.jpg" alt="IMG_0241"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Times Square was next on the agenda for the day - visit number one - daytime. I reached the iconic square, and actually encountered the real Spider-Man. Much to my surprise, I also found Batman and Catwoman chilling there too. Oh, and Darth, Chewie and a storm trooper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661780900/" title="IMG_0165 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8264/8661780900_bffb106848.jpg" alt="IMG_0165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661775634/" title="IMG_0227 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8661775634_99bcee3090.jpg" alt="IMG_0227"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660672461/" title="IMG_0232 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8660672461_5d3f97e578.jpg" alt="IMG_0232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=cfc7e68417&amp;photo_id=8711295610&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=cfc7e68417&amp;photo_id=8711295610&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea this was where they all hung out! I guess it’s as good a place as any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661779284/" title="IMG_0222 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8661779284_4d7cc96d95.jpg" alt="IMG_0222"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661777704/" title="IMG_0225 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8661777704_8d73243538.jpg" alt="IMG_0225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My (essential) nighttime visit would take place another time, as I made my way back to the house, picking up some beer on the way, chilling with the girls watching a movie, drinking, and ordering takeaway. Ahhhhhh...... lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had pre-booked my place for the following morning - the 9/11 memorial site understandably has extremely strict security measures in place. This includes reserving your visiting time slot online beforehand - registering all your details, and a comprehensive airport-esque security check on your arrival at the memorial. After making your way through security, you come out on a large expanse of land, in stark contrast to the congested blocks surrounding you. In the footprints of where the towers stood, two large pools have been constructed, with water cascading down the edges before sinking into a hole in the middle to repeat the process. The names of all the victims are carved into bronze panels surrounding the pools, allowing the public to stand and pay their respects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a memorial, the sheer number of people there does mean it isn’t exactly quiet, and all the people taking photos (guilty of this myself) does make it seem like more of a tourist attraction unfortunately. It’s a sad place to be when you think of all the people who lost their lives there, but overall I think what they’ve done with the memorial there is appropriate and fitting. The new tower is called One World Trade Center (with the crane on top in the Manhattan skyline photo I included earlier) and was actually finished just after I left. It now stands higher than the Empire State Building at 1776 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660670341/" title="IMG_0243 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8256/8660670341_c7f277abff.jpg" alt="IMG_0243"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660668349/" title="IMG_0245 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8660668349_40afc7357f.jpg" alt="IMG_0245"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661768048/" title="IMG_0256 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8661768048_f889bc4dc0.jpg" alt="IMG_0256"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to that evening, as I had a ticket to go and see the Yankees play at Yankee Stadium. I had some time to kill before then though, so I visited Central Park and spent a few hours there. It’s absolutely huge, you could probably spend the whole day there if you really wanted to. I never saw Macaulay Culkin running around with a weird pigeon lady though, which I was pretty upset about. And if you don’t know what I mean, how can you not have seen Home Alone 2 as a kid?! Your childhood wasn’t complete, go watch it, quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660663681/" title="IMG_0278 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8660663681_320dd7cf71.jpg" alt="IMG_0278"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660660607/" title="IMG_0320 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/8660660607_12d0af47bc.jpg" alt="IMG_0320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660658337/" title="IMG_0321 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8254/8660658337_1c0eb89856.jpg" alt="IMG_0321"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660582677/" title="IMG_1013 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8264/8660582677_c8f376b8ed.jpg" alt="IMG_1013"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660580379/" title="IMG_1018 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8660580379_3ce82daf8a.jpg" alt="IMG_1018"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660578365/" title="IMG_1019 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8660578365_70c36e4b60.jpg" alt="IMG_1019"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660570609/" title="IMG_1189 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8660570609_dae391b626.jpg" alt="IMG_1189"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660566397/" title="IMG_1243 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8660566397_92229af348.jpg" alt="IMG_1243"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660565115/" title="IMG_1277 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8660565115_af61ef07be.jpg" alt="IMG_1277"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, full disclosure... I’ve never watched a baseball game in my life. I have no idea what the rules are, how exactly you play (other than trying to whack the ball then running), or how it’s scored. Despite all that, I just HAD to go see a Yankees game while I was in New York! I actually think it would have been criminal for me not to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid for the nosebleed seat, on a budget... high up in the stands, getting there nice and early to soak in the pre-game atmosphere and sink my teeth into my corndog! Oh, and my chicken strips...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660692843/" title="IMG_0387 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8660692843_3fcb1fa2ac.jpg" alt="IMG_0387"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661753684/" title="IMG_0391 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8256/8661753684_6a79bf9bf9.jpg" alt="IMG_0391"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8661752528/" title="IMG_0393 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8661752528_711038e3cf.jpg" alt="IMG_0393"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660649635/" title="IMG_0401 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8660649635_dfecbbd6c6.jpg" alt="IMG_0401"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8660646747/" title="IMG_0415 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8660646747_7493074343.jpg" alt="IMG_0415"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game started, and as predicted I had absolutely no clue what was going on, but I was excited anyway...

It was my last stop in New Zealand, so I was a little upset at the prospect of leaving such a nice country. At the same time I was mega excited as New York, New York was so close I could almost taste it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hostel in Auckland was another big one, as you'd expect for such a large city. The best bit was there was a couple of young football teams there taking part in some local competition, so they were running around screaming a lot and generally being annoying. No really... it was great. Actually the hostels in New Zealand were very different to the other ones I'd stayed in, in terms of the guests. New Zealand had a much wider variety of ages of people, from young teams and such like, to more "seasoned" travellers who I guess were also taking advantage of the cheap accommodation to see the country. I didn't really see that in the other places I went to, it was mostly just younger people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious landmark in Auckland is the Sky Tower, which of course is pretty hard to miss. Especially when crazy people are base jumping from the top of it! Well, I guess it is New Zealand after all. I set about exploring, heading in that general direction, but unfortunately didn't see anyone jump when I was at the bottom looking up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675189212/" title="IMG_9907 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8124/8675189212_9ed1da1d96.jpg" alt="IMG_9907"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently it's a base jump on wires – so you jump off the edge and freefall for 11 seconds before being arrested by the wires and "very smoothly" landing at the platform on the ground – at least that's the plan! So it's not like bungy where you spring back up a couple of times. Presumably so you don't hit the building!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main shopping street looked impressive, plenty to keep people amused if you're into that kind of thing (I wasn't)... at least not whilst travelling with no spare money! Every now and then a little lane would appear at the side with small restaurants and cafes to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675194340/" title="IMG_9854 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8379/8675194340_f2b3861377.jpg" alt="IMG_9854"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One that got recommended to me by Amanda - who I'd met in Wellington - was Cafe Melba. I can definitely say the setting was very nice, sat outside at a small table in one of those tiny, quaint lanes. The staff were very friendly, the service was good. The one thing that let it down (which was my fault!) was ordering "white chocolate" as I don't drink coffee, but actually receiving a white chocolate mocha (at least so I'm told by Amanda). I drank it anyway... it tasted like coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing steadily downhill, you reach the ferry terminals where the big cruise ships are docked, and then the public harbour surrounded by more restaurants and sailing trip companies. Of course I didn't need any of them, as I'd already purchased my boat at the warehouse earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9115624071/" title="IMG_9897 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9115624071_a64422e9bb.jpg" alt="IMG_9897"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterfront was really nice; I loved the architecture and cool designs they had down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674089037/" title="IMG_9887 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8674089037_d42f5cdbcf.jpg" alt="IMG_9887"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675193256/" title="IMG_9886 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8264/8675193256_16069306f6.jpg" alt="IMG_9886"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675188074/" title="IMG_9913 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8675188074_0a9dba4fb1.jpg" alt="IMG_9913"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674082691/" title="IMG_9926 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8393/8674082691_4cc61700a4.jpg" alt="IMG_9926"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;No, I don't know the girl...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675184714/" title="IMG_9928 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8393/8675184714_87420f2ac7.jpg" alt="IMG_9928"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674076615/" title="IMG_9938 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8118/8674076615_30e72328be.jpg" alt="IMG_9938"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674077753/" title="IMG_9935 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8674077753_f2599ab3e0.jpg" alt="IMG_9935"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675182432/" title="IMG_9931 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8405/8675182432_16f1f55620.jpg" alt="IMG_9931"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675187156/" title="IMG_9920 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8675187156_a32f062c09.jpg" alt="IMG_9920"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my stomach rumbling, I continued to a park to sit down and have my lunch, sharing the crumbs with the birds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675178108/" title="IMG_9951 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8675178108_90bc73a6c1.jpg" alt="IMG_9951"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather started to turn, and soon I felt the unmistakable drops of rain landing on my skin. I began making my way back to the hostel, stopping off to pick up my default lazy evening meal of pasta and tuna, and get a few photos near a creepy but cool looking graveyard. The light rain just added to the atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675176976/" title="IMG_9952 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8675176976_ebd506c3e2.jpg" alt="IMG_9952"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674072459/" title="IMG_9953 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8674072459_2e11f81e02.jpg" alt="IMG_9953"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already bought my bus ticket for the morning, worked out what time I needed to get up, and packed what little stuff I had into my bag.

My penultimate stop took me to the North East of the north island, in Coromandel. As it turns out, I was actually in the wrong part – I should have gone to Coromandel Peninsular, which is closer to the attractions in the area. No big deal though – it just meant going on a shuttle bus tour for the day with a couple of other people. In actual fact, I think it still would have been difficult to get around all the places if I'd been in the right area anyway, they were still fairly spread out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hostel I was staying at was not the usual type I'd become accustomed to. I was still sleeping in a dorm, that was still the cheapest bed there - but it was located on a campsite. An overwhelming number of people in New Zealand hire campervans to tour the country in. For me, travelling alone it wasn't really a viable option as it would have been way too expensive. But for many, it's a fantastic way to see the country. Taking full advantage of this, there are grounds all over New Zealand that provide an open patch of grass with electricity points and whatnot for them all to park up and plug in overnight. Individual chalets dotted about also made it feel very much like a holiday park! There were beautiful views of the surrounding area from the grounds – but that's something you're pretty much guaranteed with most places you go to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674125823/" title="IMG_9724 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8674125823_e4fb59c69c.jpg" alt="IMG_9724"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the immediate vicinity of the campsite, there was a pleasant parade of shops and restaurants, catering to the locals and tourists alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675230714/" title="IMG_9719 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8520/8675230714_2ec4b064f6.jpg" alt="IMG_9719"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675229932/" title="IMG_9720 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8675229932_76064185a8.jpg" alt="IMG_9720"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a point to go to a recommended restaurant to try raw oysters and mussels – as the area is well known for the quality of this food they produce. I'd never tried them before, so I was willing to at least give it a go – although I must say, when I got in there the BBQ ribs for the same price on the menu were extremely tempting! The mussels came in a tomato like sauce, and the oysters just came with balsamic. I didn't dislike them – but I probably wouldn't be ordering them again, put it that way. After finishing both dishes (and still feeling hungry!), I almost regretted not ordering the ribs! But I was glad I tried them at least. I guess I'm just not a seafood person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the campsite, what I hadn't banked on was the wailing of a loud air raid siren later that evening! Whilst running around screaming with my arms flailing around in search of an air raid shelter, I was told it's used by the fire service and is completely normal. It's only now, having just looked it up while writing this, that I've discovered it's specifically used to summon the town's volunteer fire fighters, as there is no permanent department on standby for any emergencies. It was completely surreal. And it was LOUD. Why they can't just give them beepers I don't know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day I was up early for the tour shuttle bus pickup. We first stopped off at a viewpoint which gave us a great 360 degree panorama of the area. As views, go it wasn't too shabby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674118019/" title="IMG_9759 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8674118019_476af2fd48.jpg" alt="IMG_9759"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=f75bcccb11&amp;photo_id=8710635595&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=f75bcccb11&amp;photo_id=8710635595&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we continued our journey in the bus, we were informed of a pizza place that we would be driving past, called Luke's Kitchen. Now as some of you may know, I love pizza just a tiny, little bit... so I just had to buy one from a place called Luke's Kitchen, didn't I?! We stopped off to pick up a menu. The plan was to phone them up to order when we started driving back, and pick it up on the way. Something to look forward to for the evening then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the task at hand... and we had arrived at Whitianga, where there is a very small passenger ferry which crosses the bay. Our guide dropped us off here to explore for a while in our own time, while she drove round the long way and arranged to meet us on the other side. I settled down by the water to enjoy the view and tuck into my packed lunch (yes, that's how organised I am!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675227044/" title="IMG_9741 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8675227044_1a2bd40a0d.jpg" alt="IMG_9741"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674121051/" title="IMG_9744 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8264/8674121051_4f9d55ce3d.jpg" alt="IMG_9744"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675226118/" title="IMG_9742 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8675226118_47d26c7494.jpg" alt="IMG_9742"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675223048/" title="IMG_9745 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8675223048_b4ee2f681c.jpg" alt="IMG_9745"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enjoying the water and the boats, and treating myself to an ice cream... I crossed on the ferry to meet the shuttle to drive to our next stop, Hot Water Beach. This is quite a funny one, because as you walk along the sand there are very few people on there, but in the distance you can see a huge swarm of bodies all jostling for position in one small section of the shoreline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674116687/" title="IMG_9768 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8406/8674116687_3781fdd604.jpg" alt="IMG_9768"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675218912/" title="IMG_9769 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8675218912_e6cba005e0.jpg" alt="IMG_9769"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason is because at this one point on the beach the water under the sand gets heated up by the thermal activity in the ground, and by digging down into the sand you can make your own little hotpool to lie in and relax! It sounds easy in principle – but when you actually get there you realise it's a logistical challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you need to find a spot to start digging – no small feat in itself, due to the huge number of people there! When you do eventually find a spot, you need to dig for quite a while before you have anything even remotely resembling a pool to lie in. The chances then are quite high that your pool will either be too hot, or too cold – so you then need to try and construct a channel from someone else's pool to steal all their hot water! Even after you've got the temperature bang on, you can't yet lie back and enjoy your work – as you need to build up a big wall at the front in an attempt to stop any rogue waves that decide to ruin the spa atmosphere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it's great fun, if a little hard work! And to be honest, it's not exactly a pool you end up with – more of a puddle... but really cool nonetheless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675217844/" title="IMG_9771 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8675217844_20a4670491.jpg" alt="IMG_9771"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digging out our pool...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675216794/" title="IMG_9780 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8401/8675216794_7cccd7ac96.jpg" alt="IMG_9780"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;A well earned break...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675215632/" title="IMG_9785 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8675215632_321a0bd5c1.jpg" alt="IMG_9785"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mind the wave!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a while enjoying the "relaxation" of the beach, we continued on to Cathedral Cove. Coincidentally, part of a recent music video by Macklemore was shot at this location (skip to 3:37 in the following video to see it):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2zNSgSzhBfM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675214318/" title="IMG_9801 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8675214318_2d1af7a3cd.jpg" alt="IMG_9801"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675211810/" title="IMG_9822 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8675211810_47275d6938.jpg" alt="IMG_9822"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674107495/" title="IMG_9829 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8531/8674107495_e773b51a3b.jpg" alt="IMG_9829"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674106737/" title="IMG_9834 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8674106737_6d5272a3d2.jpg" alt="IMG_9834"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a well deserved dip in the water here, and a short sit on the beach, the time came to make our way back to the campsite. Not forgetting to stop and pick up my delicious pizza on the way back! Oh – the sunset wasn't the worst I've seen either....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/9106810821/" title="8675208940_aa72654c42_o_cropped by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/9106810821_61ac931be1.jpg" alt="8675208940_aa72654c42_o_cropped"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/3683111514858388179/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/06/coromandel.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3683111514858388179'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3683111514858388179'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/06/coromandel.html' title='Coromandel'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zNSgSzhBfM/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1966256670001402219</id><published>2013-06-18T13:27:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-06-18T13:27:41.983+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Paihia'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Paihia</title><content type='html'>The coach pass I'd bought when I first arrived in New Zealand allowed me to use my assigned number of "trips" to book various tours throughout the country. I'd used some of these already for my Milford Sound and Glowworm cave adventures, and the next one I'd arranged was a boat trip in Paihia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn't just any boat trip though... oh no... this was a dolphin boat trip! I was hoping this one would be a little livelier than the last one I'd been on way back in Cambodia. Technically I'd seen dolphins there, but only for a second or two at a time – just as they were ducking back under the water. Much like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683233778/" title="Kratie-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7263/7683233778_7f83fb6946.jpg" alt="Kratie-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out I needn't have worried! The Paihia Bottlenose dolphins must have heard about my disappointing time with their Irrawaddy cousins, as they put on a great performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585431838/" title="Paihia-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8585431838_710d04bdc0.jpg" alt="Paihia-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584341889/" title="Paihia-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8584341889_666bf24803.jpg" alt="Paihia-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585428392/" title="Paihia-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8585428392_6874cf49bb.jpg" alt="Paihia-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584345225/" title="Paihia-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8584345225_2c6fab92da.jpg" alt="Paihia-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674155179/" title="IMG_9485 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8674155179_8edd43df1c.jpg" alt="IMG_9485"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I nearly didn't get to enjoy the dolphin shenanigans though, as the boat ran into engine troubles not long after it left the dock. We were floating in one spot for maybe half an hour while the crew worked on it below deck. Luckily they got it up and running again and back up to full speed, and we were soon flying along with the dolphins swimming alongside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat was packed, and I had to push a few people overboard in order to get room to take my photos from the side of the boat. I think it was a worthwhile sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour was named the "Hole in The Rock" tour, as, funnily enough, one of the attractions was a big hole in the rock in one of the bays, big enough to sail the boat through. This was clearly a popular thing to do, as we weren't the only big boat there to make the trip. We queued up behind them and watched them breeze through first, before bringing up the rear. It was quite amusing listening to the Captain on the tannoy before we went through... she sounded quite nervous as the water was a little rougher than usual. Potentially a Titanic style disaster, but thankfully nothing that serious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675254636/" title="IMG_9613 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8541/8675254636_4d33c1e7c9.jpg" alt="IMG_9613"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674148961/" title="IMG_9642 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8674148961_fc5c7e4d94.jpg" alt="IMG_9642"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=a417bdfed4&amp;photo_id=8714167820&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=a417bdfed4&amp;photo_id=8714167820&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way back we stopped in the pleasant seaside town of Russell, home to no more than 1000 people. A little bonus of going on the tour is that they gave you a free ferry ticket back to Paihia in the price, so I stayed there for an hour or two and the tour boat returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a lookout there I could have walked up to if I was feeling energetic – on this particular day I wasn't, so I contented myself with just wandering around and then sitting down with an ice cream by the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675247694/" title="IMG_9684 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8675247694_b4c6313a26.jpg" alt="IMG_9684"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675249016/" title="IMG_9680 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8675249016_bd8f4b9058.jpg" alt="IMG_9680"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674143459/" title="IMG_9685 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8674143459_9dc9d6a70a.jpg" alt="IMG_9685"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675245742/" title="IMG_9687 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8398/8675245742_3aa22c3bdc.jpg" alt="IMG_9687"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675244326/" title="IMG_9688 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8675244326_8055bee289.jpg" alt="IMG_9688"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674140069/" title="IMG_9692 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8402/8674140069_e01e9ffb9c.jpg" alt="IMG_9692"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christ Church, New Zealand's oldest church attracted quite a few people, and it was quite a pretty place – not many graveyards you can say that about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night in the dorm was quite unusual, in a large, 8 bed room I was the only one sleeping in there! You'd think it would be perfect with a bit of extra privacy, but it was bizarre! You know you've been travelling a while when you actually think it's strange not to be sharing a room with strangers!&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1966256670001402219/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/06/paihia.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1966256670001402219'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1966256670001402219'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/06/paihia.html' title='Paihia'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1741492819759184961</id><published>2013-06-07T22:32:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-06-07T22:32:17.572+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Rotorua'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Rotorua</title><content type='html'>If you're planning on visiting Rotorua, do so with a clothes peg firmly clamped over your nostrils. It whiffs a little...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not due to the locals having eaten too many baked beans, but the thermal activity in the area producing hydrogen sulphide emissions, which smell like rotten eggs. While I guess this may put some people off, the novelty of walking around town and encountering bubbling pools of mud and steaming chasms does more than make up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585863058/" title="Rotorua-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8515/8585863058_5776622e86.jpg" alt="Rotorua-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=bd76927ffb&amp;photo_id=8711197511&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=bd76927ffb&amp;photo_id=8711197511&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city itself is not very busy, and has some nice architecture and buildings to admire while exploring. However, the main event really is the thermal "goings-on". There was one point where an area in Sulphur Bay was cordoned off and signs warned people not to pass beyond that point as the deceptively hard surface was actually very thin, and there was a danger of it cracking underfoot and you getting scalded by ridiculously hot steam rising from below. I watched as some people blatantly ignored this and began wandering all over the area past the barrier. I secretly hoped for the ground to crack beneath them as a consequence of their idiocy, but alas – no joy. I continued my wandering in disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584594877/" title="Rotorua-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8584594877_d254e142d3.jpg" alt="Rotorua-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584599279/" title="Rotorua-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8112/8584599279_f72ee3bf9c.jpg" alt="Rotorua-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584718685/" title="Rotorua-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8584718685_6bb019f1ca.jpg" alt="Rotorua-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585875912/" title="Rotorua-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8585875912_cb92b35fa4.jpg" alt="Rotorua-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584788217/" title="Rotorua-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8584788217_9e70ec74b9.jpg" alt="Rotorua-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short way outside the city (but, predictably far enough that I'd have to pay for a shuttle/day tour thing!) is the Wai-O-Tapu Thermal Wonderland! I know, it sounds a little overhyped... but it is pretty good, and certainly on another level to the small, bubbling mud pools immediately surrounding the city. One thing that was a little underwhelming, and didn't exactly live up to the "Wonderland" title was the Lady Knox geyser. It promised an "eruption" every day at 10am, which we arrived for in plenty of time on the minibus. Now I don't know about you, but when I hear the word eruption I expect something pretty violent, maybe powerful enough to blow the front row of tourists 10 feet back in the air with a loud, explosive bang! It was incredibly disappointing, it quietly spurted some water and steam (admittedly) fairly high into the air, but it was all rather tame for my liking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674198115/" title="IMG_5347 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8674198115_1104b19327.jpg" alt="IMG_5347"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the wonderland was filled with a bit more wonder though... the huge variety of amazing, natural colours on display if nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675303706/" title="IMG_5346 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8406/8675303706_6846832251.jpg" alt="IMG_5346"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675305066/" title="IMG_5345 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8394/8675305066_0a14fc2bea.jpg" alt="IMG_5345"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mud flies through the air at the bubbling pools...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675301042/" title="IMG_5354 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8675301042_9025854be5.jpg" alt="IMG_5354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674195971/" title="IMG_5355 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/8674195971_368afac1aa.jpg" alt="IMG_5355"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675296852/" title="IMG_5357 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8675296852_d8233ca600.jpg" alt="IMG_5357"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674191217/" title="IMG_5358 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8674191217_fb48411c0b.jpg" alt="IMG_5358"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675293216/" title="IMG_5359 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8395/8675293216_6885552056.jpg" alt="IMG_5359"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675285950/" title="IMG_5365 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8114/8675285950_017006ee42.jpg" alt="IMG_5365"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675283714/" title="IMG_5367 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8531/8675283714_5b7f019751.jpg" alt="IMG_5367"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674174469/" title="IMG_5371 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8674174469_d861c1f82b.jpg" alt="IMG_5371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After arriving back in town at the end of the thermal wonderland trip, I was keen to visit the Wingspan National Bird of Prey Centre. This is a little known "attraction" in the area, as they don't market themselves as a tourist destination as such. Indeed, when I'd previously asked about them in the iSite visitor's centre, they hadn't heard of them before. They're actually a conservation, education and research organisation for birds of prey. Every day at a set time, they provide a flying display of their birds which I really wanted to catch. I'd enjoyed the one I'd seen at the koala sanctuary in Brisbane, but that wasn't really the main attraction and hadn't lasted very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, once again I was at a disadvantage not having my own transportation. I had to resort to catching a taxi as walking all the way would have made me late for the display. I realise this makes me sound like a complete cheapskate, but when you're backpacking (especially as it was near the end of my trip!) I had to watch the pennies pretty closely! Anyway, I made it in good time, and after having a look around their large aviary, I settled down with the other people there (only around seven or eight people, it was great!) to watch the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8674167017/" title="IMG_5376 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8674167017_dec103d42f.jpg" alt="IMG_5376"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8675268830/" title="IMG_5377 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8675268830_06b7917daa.jpg" alt="IMG_5377"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apparently they puff themselves up and look like a big furball before they fly...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584351015/" title="Rotorua-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8584351015_d2b2f5b1be.jpg" alt="Rotorua-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584355053/" title="Rotorua-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8088/8584355053_2f30af2d0f.jpg" height="192" alt="Rotorua-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were also allowed to hold the birds, which was rather awesome.

Apart from your tandem master, who I'd imagine would have some fairly major hearing problems by the end of their career. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's well known throughout the backpacker circuit that Taupo is the place to do your skydive. Not only is it a great view while you're jumping, but it's cheaper than other places in New Zealand - presumably as so many people go there. Also only one person goes SPLAT per week, so your chances of survival are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having already booked my jump online before I arrived, I was dismayed to arrive on the coach the day before to cloudy skies and rain. In these conditions, it's impossible for the jump to go ahead as you need visibility of the ground while you are falling (for obvious reasons). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally I was hoping for the best the following morning as my alarm went off. When I arose it was cloudy, but not as bad as it had been the previous day. As a matter of course, you are instructed to phone the skydive company some time before you are due to be picked up by their shuttle. When I phoned the first time they asked me to call back in ten minutes, as they were waiting to see if the cloud cover that was over the airfield currently would clear with the wind. Ten anxious minutes later, I redialled their number. The cloud had moved... the jump was on. There was no getting out of it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at the airfield, I finally got to see what I would be *gulp* jumping out of. It didn't even look like it could take off, let alone climb to 15,000 ft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584119617/" title="Taupo-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8584119617_6a3138cd40.jpg" alt="Taupo-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584076113/" title="Taupo-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8584076113_94658d3070.jpg" alt="Taupo-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584082375/" title="Taupo-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8584082375_e2d9b84041.jpg" alt="Taupo-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585225632/" title="Taupo-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8585225632_ca704a2e5e.jpg" alt="Taupo-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting kitted up, and meeting my tandem master Elad (aka crazy person), I began my final walk to the plane. In total there were around twenty people on there, and it was a really tight fit. That was really the last thing on my mind though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566236797/" title="GOPR9113 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8088/8566236797_c06291294c.jpg" alt="GOPR9113"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 15-20 minutes to get to the right height. You have a choice of jumping from either 12,000 or 15,000 ft. Everyone in our group had opted to jump at the higher altitude, so we had no delays in getting up there. Packed in like sardines, the noise from the engines drowns out any last minute prayers you may be making. As we got closer to the jump height, we were handed an oxygen mask and pumped full of gas. One would logically assume this is because the cabin isn't pressurised, and the oxygen levels are lower as you climb higher. You could also quite easily believe it's just to "take the edge off" and make you a little more compliant when your turn to jump comes around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566234643/" title="GOPR9142 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8527/8566234643_09e742cc56.jpg" alt="GOPR9142"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 15 minutes were soon up. I was second in line to jump. The roller hatch was pulled up, and the guys in front scooted forward on their arse. Turning 90 degrees, they were then dangling precariously on the edge. The cameraman clambered out of the opening and was literally hanging off the side of the plane. He is the one who jumps at the same time as you, but separately, to film you with a helmet mounted camera. Heads turned to the left, for one last photo before the inevitable. Then, on the count of three, they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was now a big empty space between me and the hatch. Any thoughts you might have at this point of scrambling backwards toward the front of the plane, and clinging onto the pilot for dear life are scuppered, as you are strapped on tight to your tandem master. Edging slowly forward inch by inch, we reached the side of the plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cameraman did his Spiderman bit, climbing out to hang onto the side. It felt as if I was just dangling, as the tandem master is actually sitting on the edge, but you're just in front of him, held in the straps. Moving my head around, there was just time for one last photo (I went for abject terror, I think I nailed it), before I was hurled forward and begin falling. Very, very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566192729/" title="IMG_8988 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8566192729_2e16163435.jpg" alt="IMG_8988"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FtHwoFlxD94" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first things are, quite literally, a blur. Despite wearing goggles, the air still rushed around the edges and made my eyes water. The noise is huge, as air blasted past my ears. I felt a tap on my shoulder, an indication that I should extend my arms to make things easier for Elad. Up until this point, you are instructed to hold onto your shoulder straps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soon spotted the cameraman in front of us, who grew closer and began waving his arms around in front of him, as if trying to signal me to do something. This continued for most of the time we were free falling, hence the confused expression on my face for the majority of the video! Luckily I'd opted for the photos package too, so I could at least pick out some normal photos from those (or as normal as you could ever look falling through the air at approximately 120mph!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8567312616/" title="_MG_6028 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8110/8567312616_09aae95b58.jpg" alt="_MG_6028"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566218987/" title="_MG_5962 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8566218987_e772e02f83.jpg" alt="_MG_5962"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8567330176/" title="GOPR9169 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8567330176_7a50c85f6a.jpg" alt="GOPR9169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8567314090/" title="_MG_6001 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8110/8567314090_9e7bb0afd1.jpg" alt="_MG_6001"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After around one minute of freefall, another tap on the shoulder told me to grab hold of my shoulder straps again, and our descent was immediately arrested as the parachute was deployed. You can get a feel for just how quickly this happens by watching the cameramen in the video continue falling further down before opening their own chutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After what felt like complete chaos from the moment we exited the plane, a deafening silence took over and for the first time I could properly take in what was going on. I was worried that with some cloud still in the sky, it would spoil the view somewhat, but even with cloud in places the view was spectacular. It was completely unique too, obviously at no time would I ever be at that vantage point again, and it really was something else - as you can see from the stupid grin on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8567326814/" title="GOPR9220 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8567326814_8083748f13.jpg" alt="GOPR9220"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8567329044/" title="GOPR9195 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8524/8567329044_ee4e4747d3.jpg" alt="GOPR9195"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566228869/" title="GOPR9224 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8566228869_cf62380d02.jpg" alt="GOPR9224"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566227769/" title="GOPR9232 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8566227769_d31e74d967.jpg" alt="GOPR9232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elad passed me the handles for the parachute, and let me steer us around for a while, going all over the place, which was so much fun. As we grew closer to the ground, he took control again and made us go into a steep spiral downwards which was awesome! We levelled out again, and directly below us was the landing spot where we could already see the first guys had arrived. We descended steadily, and as we approached the ground I lifted my legs as instructed and we came back to earth with a very smooth landing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8567322822/" title="GOPR9302 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8515/8567322822_d52cf7a936.jpg" alt="GOPR9302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8566224051/" title="GOPR9307 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8566224051_96b0be84e7.jpg" alt="GOPR9307"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adrenaline rush is amazing. Compared to the bungy, it was actually less scary believe it or not. I think it's because you're further away from the ground so you don't really have a perception of the height you're at. Overall it was definitely more fun than the bungy though, as it lasts longer so you have more time to appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again I got extremely lucky with the weather, as it was like this shortly after we landed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584122105/" title="Taupo-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8584122105_d989587826.jpg" alt="Taupo-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584131887/" title="Taupo-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8527/8584131887_72034b8b2a.jpg" alt="Taupo-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second group that had booked the time after ours was actually unable to jump. They were given the option of getting taken back into town or waiting around to see if it would clear. Throughout the day it rained on and off though, so I was very lucky to have booked the first jump and actually been able to go ahead with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily recommend skydiving to anybody. You'll enjoy it, I guarantee you. Even if you're terrified at first, after doing it you'll not regret it. It's amazing. Just don't forget the parachute.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2212250603691755037/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/06/taupo.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2212250603691755037'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2212250603691755037'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/06/taupo.html' title='Taupo'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/FtHwoFlxD94/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7579025135141808634</id><published>2013-05-30T16:57:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-30T16:57:45.974+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Napier'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Napier</title><content type='html'>Napier is home to a large amount of art deco buildings in and around the city. One street in particular is full of them. Art deco isn't one of my favourite design styles, but it somehow seemed to work well in Napier and certainly gave the city a very unique atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585550046/" title="Napier-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8585550046_c05b4fa9ef.jpg" alt="Napier-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584475947/" title="Napier-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8524/8584475947_cbd710fe99.jpg" alt="Napier-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584481369/" title="Napier-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8584481369_91e744c49c.jpg" alt="Napier-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584488635/" title="Napier-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8584488635_2526982a45.jpg" alt="Napier-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584484695/" title="Napier-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8584484695_5ea04bfd24.jpg" alt="Napier-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Jaguar E-Type looked right at home...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all my time travelling, up until New Zealand, there was always something I felt was missing. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Something I didn't even know I wanted, or even needed, until I stumbled upon it walking around Napier. Yes folks, that missing piece of the puzzle was....... Trainworld!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585554474/" title="Napier-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8585554474_c2f92865c5.jpg" alt="Napier-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, it just amused me really. Not exactly Disneyworld is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the shoreline lies the Marine Parade, a nice enough walk along by the beach, with parks and sculptures and a few shops. Luckily enough it was a sunny day while I was there, and I was able to enjoy the warm weather again (as I write this looking out on the cold, wet British weather!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584518815/" title="Napier-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8584518815_e3c3045a59.jpg" alt="Napier-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584522137/" title="Napier-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8584522137_548d6d166a.jpg" alt="Napier-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585629116/" title="Napier-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8585629116_5cfe5224cd.jpg" alt="Napier-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584533701/" title="Napier-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8507/8584533701_033c234586.jpg" alt="Napier-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585641026/" title="Napier-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8585641026_86f1bb1d37.jpg" alt="Napier-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585644942/" title="Napier-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8530/8585644942_04026c6ca0.jpg" alt="Napier-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next stop was Taupo, where I had booked my skydive! I just hoped the nice weather would hold out until I got there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wandering back inland, I came to a nice park with plenty of colourful flowers. Right by it was a farmer's market, where I just had to buy a cake. I forgot to take a picture, but it was a huge plum sponge which was pretty darn tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584458167/" title="Napier-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8584458167_12b4f84f1f.jpg" alt="Napier-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585561308/" title="Napier-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8585561308_b2ce7276c4.jpg" alt="Napier-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585565394/" title="Napier-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8585565394_5158bc6a3a.jpg" alt="Napier-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585568396/" title="Napier-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8366/8585568396_2443b3b4c9.jpg" alt="Napier-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584472125/" title="Napier-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8584472125_8ca2dc0dd9.jpg" alt="Napier-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only a tiny place, so there wasn't really anything else I could see or do that day – again, not without having a car to explore a little further out. Luckily I'd only planned one day there anyway, and the following morning I was heading to the place. The place where people fall from the sky with some fabric strapped to their back, held on by string. &lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/7579025135141808634/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/napier.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7579025135141808634'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7579025135141808634'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/napier.html' title='Napier'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2218516294787310507</id><published>2013-05-28T19:33:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-28T22:29:02.021+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Tongariro National Park'/><title type='text'>Tongariro National Park</title><content type='html'>When you travel to the Tongariro National Park, it's with one goal in mind... completing the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Home to Mount Ngauruhoe (which formed the basis for Mount Doom in the Lord of the Rings trilogy - after being digitally altered, mind) and luckily with less orcs and ringwraiths and whatnot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The footwear I'd bought with me had served me well up until now, a pair of Keen Newport H2 sandals. These are not only at the peak of backpacker fashion, but have a sturdy sole, toecap to save your toes from any nasty impacts and are completely submersible in water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8871839754/" title="5003-150_BK000_view1_1000x1000 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5322/8871839754_14bb268a60.jpg" alt="5003-150_BK000_view1_1000x1000"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wore these on hikes, living in flip flops (thongs if you're Aussie) the vast majority of the time. Unfortunately on this occasion, they just weren't going to cut it. In fact, if I had worn them, they would have been the ones getting cut, literally. Here's what happened to some poor guy's shoes, the terrain is that rough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584235075/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8584235075_613e05f67d.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that meant hiring boots from somewhere. I had the option of going with some relatively new, shiny, modern ones from a local hire shop in the very small town. However, the hostel (never missing the opportunity to make some more money!) also had boots for hire at a much cheaper cost. These appeared to be from the 1800's, but I'd heard boots get more comfortable with age, so I figured these ones must almost float over the ground. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585285312/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8585285312_b924e0222b.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn't, sadly. And they gave me blisters. But at least they didn't fall apart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up early the next morning, and I loaded myself and my pack onto the shuttle bus from the hostel to the start of the crossing. The bus was full, and there were at least five or six others there when we arrived, that's how popular this walk is. I had loaded my pack with enough food and water to sustain a small army, based on an experience I had in the rainforest in Malaysia, woefully underestimating the amount of water I would need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun was still low in the sky as I began walking, making for a nice warm light over the rocky, dry landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584172735/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8584172735_f2076e758c.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584175905/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8584175905_afefb56a00.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cold at first, but the sun rapidly increased the temperature, and I soon had to stop to remove my fleece and take on some water. The going was easy at first, nice and flat and very little effort. It would have been easy to get lulled into a false sense of security, but I knew it would soon get a lot tougher!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, on approaching the last of the available toilet stops along the route, you could see the path rise steadily up and up the rock. This was a little harder... it always is going uphill! Nice views when you get up there though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584182439/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8235/8584182439_f6442069dd.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584179133/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8584179133_0fae9dd3da.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On reaching the top of that climb, you're presented with two choices. You can either climb Mount Doom, or continue further along the track and get to a different lookout point, above the Emerald Lakes. Some brave (crazy) people I'd spoken to had actually done both in the same day before. But, I wouldn't have had the pleasure of doing this even if I'd wanted to. The bus driver had already told us that we would only have time to do one of the two, before they came back to pick us up at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584221193/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8584221193_baa29e0f84.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As cool as it would have been to say I climbed Mount Doom, it looked like way too much hard work for me! There was loose scree all the way up, and for every couple of steps up you took, you would slide down almost the same amount. After standing at the base watching people struggle upwards, I decided I'd be perfectly happy seeing the Emerald Lakes! I left the hard work to Frodo and Sam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584239363/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8584239363_364d95936d.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, those people are actually dressed as hobbits. No, I have no idea why either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After choosing the easy option, there's a long flat, straight again before you reach another steep uphill climb. This one was trickier, as there were no steps so you had to mind your footing. There was still solid ground for the most part though, so it was a hell of a lot easier than the alternative I'd already dismissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585341846/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8585341846_efcf3e7ef0.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsurprisingly, around halfway up the path levelled out to provide more fantastic views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585293528/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8103/8585293528_705bfe0cdd.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=29f21a5132&amp;photo_id=8711052837&amp;hd_default=false"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=29f21a5132&amp;photo_id=8711052837&amp;hd_default=false" height="281" width="500"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just enough time to get your breath here, before continuing up the steepest section to the very top. The reward was well worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584238259/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8584238259_7df9c0f756.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585330682/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8585330682_2424498474.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584228595/" title="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8584228595_a14360320c.jpg" alt="National Park &amp;amp; The Tongariro Crossing-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were many people gathered at this point, as it was a perfect spot to sit and eat your packed lunch and take in the view for a while before turning round and heading back the way you came. You can usually continue onwards, but volcanic activity in the area had forced the authorities to close the track from that point (or a little further on), deeming it unsafe for the time being to go any further. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite happy staying there anyway... the path dropped away steeply down the other side and was also nothing but shingle. Watching plenty of people first slide down the slope initially (a lot of them ending up on their arse), then some time later struggle back up, slipping down in the loose rock – I was content to just sit at the top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stayed there for at least an hour, more I think – taking in the view, before the time came when I had to head back to the car park for the coach (or risk being left behind!). It's funny how the path seemed a lot longer when my feet were beginning to ache and my blisters were rubbing! I got there eventually though, and soon enough arrived back at the hostel to have a well earned break for the rest of the day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2218516294787310507/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/tongariro-national-park.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2218516294787310507'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2218516294787310507'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/tongariro-national-park.html' title='Tongariro National Park'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5240709251509004395</id><published>2013-05-21T16:37:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-21T16:37:58.799+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Wellington'/><title type='text'>Wellington</title><content type='html'>Wellington. Capital of New Zealand since 1865. Home to the biggest hostel I've ever seen. 320 beds over six floors make it seem more like a hotel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I arrived in the city, and began the walk from the coach stop, the rain began to fall. I was on a mission to find an electronics store, for a new charging cable for my iPhone. The connector had bent and all the wires were coming out. Running repairs and replacement items are part and parcel of the backpacker experience (especially when you lose things a lot, like me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my dorm, I met Flo (German, short for Florian) and Amanda, from Washington. None of us had any particular plans while we were there, so we spent the following day exploring the city together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585382408/" title="Wellington-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8585382408_c579f8fe0f.jpg" alt="Wellington-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a photo from the top of Mount Victoria Lookout, which gave spectacular 360 degree views over the area. Again, I got very lucky with the weather and had clear blue skies giving great visibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585379526/" title="Wellington-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8585379526_f38c0c5325.jpg" alt="Wellington-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda had originally intended to spend longer travelling, but her plans changed to a shorter trip. This meant she had a fair bit of extra money to enjoy while she was there, and certainly made the most of it that night. She'd booked a posh, forty seven course meal (OK, I'm slightly exaggerating) which cost a couple of hundred dollars, including the wine that was specifically chosen to accompany each course. Flo and I were very jealous. Tuna pasta this certainly was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She enjoyed it immensely. I was shocked and appalled she didn't bring any back to the hostel in a doggy bag for us, but you can't win them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a break in our explorations that day, I briefly met up with Sarah on her lunch hour, a Kiwi who had come to work for my old company back in London for a short while. She's a lawyer, and had recently moved to Wellington for a new job, which apparently was going very well. She was still settling into the city and getting used to it herself. Conveniently, right by her workplace was the entrance to the Wellington Cable Car, which took you up to the top of another hill where the Botanic Gardens are. Meeting up with Flo and Amanda again, we made our way to the top via the steep, noisy cable car. Appreciating the views there for a while, we slowly wandered back down through the gardens, heading back to the city centre at the bottom. At this point we nearly got lost. Again – thank God for Google Maps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584275229/" title="Wellington-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8584275229_5ae54e804e.jpg" alt="Wellington-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterfront, and the top of the Te Papa museum provided further viewing opportunities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584247433/" title="Wellington-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8584247433_2a265d8ae2.jpg" alt="Wellington-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585350066/" title="Wellington-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8088/8585350066_28305ac05f.jpg" alt="Wellington-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585359586/" title="Wellington-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8371/8585359586_a43cff3c69.jpg" alt="Wellington-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584268679/" title="Wellington-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8584268679_28481739b6.jpg" alt="Wellington-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, combined with the weather, Wellington was a very nice place to be. There are plenty of bars and restaurants, and it's apparently the craft beer capital also. Naturally that night we thought it only rude not to visit a craft beer bar to sample this for ourselves. The beer was good. The price wasn't. Good thing a visit to that particular type of bar isn't the norm, or I definitely would have run out of money a lot sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By night, the view from the other side of the harbour is beautiful, as the lights of the city reflect in the water. Unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me, so you'll just have to take my word on that one! Eventually, we got too cold and headed back to the hotel hostel. Someone was watching American Gangster in the TV room. I'd already seen it a couple of nights ago in Nelson, but I watched it again anyway. Good film. In my bunk that night, my thoughts turned to my next destination... Mount Doom, with Frodo and Sam.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/5240709251509004395/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/wellington.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5240709251509004395'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5240709251509004395'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/wellington.html' title='Wellington'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-6827126099034564786</id><published>2013-05-19T13:04:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-19T13:04:12.563+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Nelson'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Nelson</title><content type='html'>Nelson didn't really blow me away to be honest. The hostel was located in town with all the obligatory shops and supermarkets, a few parks and Christ Church Cathedral. These were nice to wander around for a while, but if I'm honest after the amazing sights elsewhere in the country it's almost like the bar was set too high!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585394962/" title="Nelson-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8585394962_a8e09cc5e8.jpg" alt="Nelson-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584298959/" title="Nelson-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8584298959_c972803886.jpg" alt="Nelson-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585403278/" title="Nelson-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8585403278_b2ceabcaa0.jpg" alt="Nelson-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584310699/" title="Nelson-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8584310699_130d9a1df7.jpg" alt="Nelson-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585415140/" title="Nelson-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8090/8585415140_15da9cde82.jpg" alt="Nelson-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lack of a car once again worked to my disadvantage, as I set off on a walk to the beach which took me absolutely ages and over a huge hill!

The parents were there visiting their daughter who had moved to New Zealand for work. It turns out the guy used to live in Selsdon, which is just up the road from where I live now! Back in Vietnam I'd also met a girl who used to work at one of the restaurants I went to for a Christmas party at my old job in Wimbledon. It's funny that you can go so far around the world and still run into people from back home. They do say it's a small world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night before I was due to leave, I managed to pull off a spectacular Luke special. As it got close to dinnertime, I went up to the dorm room and for some odd reason I left the key in the lock as I unlocked the door and entered the room. I knew I'd done this, and I told myself to take it out as I was leaving, but I obviously didn't, as late that night after watching movies in the TV room, I went to go to bed and couldn't open the door as I had no key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked quietly, in case anyone was still awake (it was late, probably around 2 or 3am) but no one opened the door. I ended up having to sleep on the floor in the TV room! Luckily there were lots of big cushions to lie on, so it was comfortable enough and warm with the door closed. I got up early the next morning and luckily had enough time between reception opening and my coach leaving to quickly get in the dorm, grab my stuff and head off to the coach stop, bound for the interislander ferry, and Wellington, my first stop on the North Island.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/6827126099034564786/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/nelson.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/6827126099034564786'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/6827126099034564786'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/nelson.html' title='Nelson'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7062651597097531319</id><published>2013-05-18T13:48:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-18T13:48:43.173+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Punakaiki'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Punakaiki</title><content type='html'>Punakaiki itself... where I was staying didn't actually seem to exist! The hostel I was staying at was down a secluded dirt track into some woods, which actually made for a really nice stay in one of their cabins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8583861759/" title="Punakaiki-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8583861759_81e5d9fabe.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584942816/" title="Punakaiki-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8584942816_85a35c126a.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584938072/" title="Punakaiki-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8584938072_d6a7b0f6d2.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584931740/" title="Punakaiki-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8584931740_246a610556.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8583825913/" title="Punakaiki-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8516/8583825913_da63c94427.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely one of the nicer places on my trip, and still only about £16 per night. If you can bear to sacrifice some privacy, then hostels are definitely the way forward when you're travelling somewhere in future. In fact, most hostels also have private rooms available anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you walked up the dirt track to the main road, that's all there was for miles in either direction - tarmac. Yet again, without my own transportation I was slightly scuppered. Fortunately (as you would expect with the location of the hostel), the main attractions for Punakaiki (the Pancake Rocks and blowholes) were within walking distance of the hostel. It just meant walking along the road all the way there... nice views though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584967066/" title="Punakaiki-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8584967066_a57576a979.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After half an hour or so, I arrived at the main visitor centre for the area, and the local tearoom. I managed to resist going in for a snack, as I knew everything in there would have been incredibly expensive, and money was getting very tight by that stage! The walk down to the rocks from there is short, and you're soon by the edge of the cliff looking at fantastic views over the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585036166/" title="Punakaiki-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8585036166_9a7231de6d.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8585078600/" title="Punakaiki-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8585078600_213f2bd0cc.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8583945829/" title="Punakaiki-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8583945829_6e2bb26157.jpg" alt="Punakaiki-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "pancakes" themselves (the layers in the rock) were formed by immense water pressure on dead sea creatures and plants on the seabed. This was then lifted out of the water by seismic activity over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't able to get there when the blowholes were active – around high tide, but from what I'd read online, you weren't even guaranteed to see them in action even if you did get there at that time. It also depended on the roughness of the sea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with my pancake fill, I headed back along the main road to get to the hostel. They had a main building there with a communal TV room and kitchen – like you'd get in every hostel, but much nicer in another log cabin style arrangement. I spent the rest of the day in there, and by the time I left to wander along to my own cabin to sleep, it was dark. I was walking along the winding path through the woods, when I heard a noise up ahead. As I got closer, my light picked up what I think was a possum stopped dead in its tracks in front of me, staring. We both looked at each other in this standoff for a few seconds, before it scarpered up the nearest tree! I'm glad it wasn't bigfoot. That would have been a whole lot more scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/7062651597097531319/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/punakaiki.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7062651597097531319'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7062651597097531319'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/punakaiki.html' title='Punakaiki'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-3670808702095701487</id><published>2013-05-14T18:42:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-14T18:42:24.596+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Fox Glacier'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Fox Glacier &amp; Lake Matheson</title><content type='html'>Leaving my camera behind was a pretty stupid thing to do. Not entirely unexpected though, given my previous track record. At the next stop off point, I wandered down the coach to speak to the driver. This set in motion something I wasn't expecting at all, and something I'm sure would never have happened back home! The driver told me to give him the key. He said he would take it back down with him the following day, hand it over to another driver halfway along the route, and get him to drop it at the hostel. I should phone the hostel and ask them to open the locker when they receive the key, then drop the camera off to the information centre where the coach leaves from the following morning (checking first with the information center that they would't have a problem with this). The driver would then pick it up from there, bring it up halfway again, then hand it over to my driver who would give it to me when he reached Fox Glacier... Believe it or not, all this went off without a hitch! Two days after I arrived, I met the coach in Fox Glacier, and there was my camera, safe and sound. Thanks Kiwis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fox Glacier is 13km long, which is slightly longer than the 10km Franz Josef glacier, some 23km further North. I had heard that recently it had become impossible to access the Franz Josef glacier by anything other than helicopter, which obviously would have made the whole thing a fair bit more expensive. Fox was still accesssible by foot, which basically decided for me which one I should visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fox Glacier Guiding company offer a multitude of trips to the glacier. When walking (and not riding in the helicopter), you have the option of a half day walk (requiring a "moderate" level of fitness"), or a full day walk (requiring "good" fitness). Now, "good" is probably the last word I would have used to describe my fitness as at the time, probably not even "moderate". More like "shockingly bad" to "woeful". But, I'd come to Fox to go on the glacier, and I wanted to make sure I spent the longest time possible up there! If I'd have collapsed from exhaustion, they could have airlifted me out of there anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning of the hike, we were fitted with crampons (spikes for your boots), walking poles, coats, boots, socks, bags and any other equipment we thought we might have needed. We were then herded into the old school, renovated bus (nice touch), and headed off on the short trip to the bottom of the glacier. I have to say, it wasn't exactly a bad view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535499047/" title="Fox Glacier-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8085/8535499047_f21fcba350.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535469097/" title="Fox Glacier-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8535469097_ea80c5902e.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535562381/" title="Fox Glacier-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8535562381_84fdcb6c61.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We began by walking up stairs carved into the ice by the staff, who apparently get up there at 7 every morning to prepare the way for the hundreds of tourists arriving that day. Exhausting work, but at least they rotate so they're not doing that every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535567101/" title="Fox Glacier-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8535567101_0e15ac83c6.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing further up the glacier, as you reach a less steep section where there are no steps in sight, you are shown how to walk correctly with the crampons on your feet. When going uphill, walk "like a duck" and point your feet out to the side, when coming down a hill, bend your knees SAS style, legs wider and dig in hard with each step.

Despite wearing a long sleeved top, a t-shirt over that, and then a fleece, I was still cold. Who would have thought it, standing on a huge chunk of ice?! The guide had a spare coat stashed away in their rucksack that they lent me, along with some super stylish gardening looking gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536580426/" title="Fox Glacier-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8536580426_bcf1f6d2a9.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we continued our walk further up the glacier. Luckily, my legs weren't aching or anything and I hadn't  collapsed either, so any worries I'd had about my fitness I needn't have had! We passed the point where the guide said the half day walk would have returned, and I definitely made the right decision, as we carried on further up to the really cool stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536599610/" title="Fox Glacier-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8536599610_42791b1516.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536727894/" title="Fox Glacier-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8527/8536727894_cfab018086.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535476645/" title="Fox Glacier-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8535476645_9a52101893.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536739676/" title="Fox Glacier-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8103/8536739676_d6c0e156f2.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tall walls of ice surround you as you climb further up, only to reach huge crevices sinking deep down as far as you can see. The glacier is apparently receding at the moment due to there having been unusually dry weather in the country for that time of year. It was actually the driest February on record while I was there... lucky me! As an aside... I also got very lucky with the weather in Australia too. Having passed through Bundaberg, I kept in touch with the girls I met in the dorm there, and they'd all been evacuated due to flooding, they sent me these eye opening photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489215508/" title="Bundaberg-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8085/8489215508_45f0be4445.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evacuated to the civic centre...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488123393/" title="Bundaberg-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8488123393_11a2ecba17.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489216080/" title="Bundaberg-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8489216080_cc215ba400.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Preparing for the worst...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488123927/" title="Bundaberg-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8524/8488123927_8907cd44df.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Preparing for the worst...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8666664556/" title="Camera Roll-568 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8666664556_96b3294f4d.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-568"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489216644/" title="Bundaberg-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8489216644_aa6bb4d8ee.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Repairs needed to the walls after the hostel was flooded...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After arriving back in town from the glacier, I decided – being the glutton for punishment that I am – to walk to Lake Matheson and check that out. It's famed for having a brilliant reflected view of Aoraki/Mount Cook and Mount Tasman, which I was obviously keen to photograph. So, after a 7km walk on tired legs, and a further 1km around to the far end of the lake, I was sadly disappointed! The view was still nice, but unfortunately just a little cloudy, which obscured the peaks! Ah well – you can't win them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584905548/" title="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8584905548_ee2d5d4c26.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8583802533/" title="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8583802533_938e8e8f19.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then... a slight break in the clouds! They didn't magically disappear or anything, but at least I briefly saw the peaks! Not so bad after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584912086/" title="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8584912086_0d5f078931.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584918104/" title="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8584918104_4ecd06f3de.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8584916090/" title="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8091/8584916090_bf8d7436c8.jpg" alt="Fox Glacier &amp;amp; Lake Matheson-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could always have got up the following day (I'd deliberately scheduled a rest day after the hike!) and walked back for sunrise, but..... it would have meant getting up, and it also would have meant walking the round trip to the lake again. I decided I was quite happy with the pics I had! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd stayed past sunset where I was, as I thought the sky would have been more spectacular. This meant walking back around the lake, surrounded by forest in the growing dark, with just a dim headtorch to light the way. It was quite unnerving, to say the least. I could hear noises around me that I'm sure I wouldn't have heard in the daylight! My pace quickened, and I was soon back at the (also dark) road. At least there were fields either side of that though, so some light from the sky could be seen. But I had another odd moment, when I was sure I heard a faint voice behind me. I looked around and thought I could see a dark sillouhette approaching. The shadow grew closer, until eventually I could make out a guy jogging along in complete darkness, occasionally singing random song lyrics to himself to pass the time. He passed me, nodded, and vanished into the distance. Nothing weird about that at all... &lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/3670808702095701487/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/fox-glacier-lake-matheson.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3670808702095701487'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3670808702095701487'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/fox-glacier-lake-matheson.html' title='Fox Glacier &amp; Lake Matheson'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5986334843815804146</id><published>2013-05-08T17:06:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-08T17:06:12.465+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Wanaka'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Wanaka</title><content type='html'>Wanaka is a glorious little town situated (surprisingly) next to Lake Wanaka, in the Otago region on the southern island. Despite arriving on the coach on a cloudy, slightly drizzly day, the appeal of the place is all too apparent. From the lakeside you are treated to spectacular views across the water to the base of mountains as far as the eye can see (certainly not something New Zealand is short of!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541921352/" title="Wanaka-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8100/8541921352_ae333a7c2a.jpg" alt="Wanaka-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541910438/" title="Wanaka-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8541910438_2efefe4d1e.jpg" alt="Wanaka-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial upbeat mood was somewhat dampened when I arrived at my hostel though - I checked into my room no problem, set my bag down to open it as I'd done countless times before, when suddenly one of the straps holding the lid on the bag snapped off! I guess that's what comes of accumulating too much extra stuff along the way! I tied a knot in it, and it lasted me as a makeshift repair until I got home. As part of their "ALL MIGHTY" warranty, Osprey - the manufacturer of the bag - have let me know where to send it for repair or replacement. This lasts for the lifetime of the pack, and is great peace of mind and great customer service. So despite evidence to the contrary, the bag has been fantastic. If you're looking for a new rucksack for any reason I can definitely recommend the Osprey brand. Trust me, it's taken a lot of beating on the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanaka is not the biggest of places, but that's really its appeal. It's a good place to go to enjoy astounding scenery, in a pleasant, quiet town environment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541924386/" title="Wanaka-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8532/8541924386_a8db4a40d8.jpg" alt="Wanaka-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541931026/" title="Wanaka-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8235/8541931026_4e8831409f.jpg" alt="Wanaka-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541934712/" title="Wanaka-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8507/8541934712_e0cde9e7fe.jpg" alt="Wanaka-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541937812/" title="Wanaka-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8541937812_3ab4ebb083.jpg" alt="Wanaka-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541940658/" title="Wanaka-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8541940658_770d4deae6.jpg" alt="Wanaka-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541971336/" title="Wanaka-32 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8541971336_60e6f67ccf.jpg" alt="Wanaka-32"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short walk out of town lies Puzzling World, a place dedicated to illusions and puzzles. There are lots of fascinating exhibits here, including a hall of faces, which when you cover one eye and move around the room actually appear to turn their heads to follow you - creepy stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You walk slightly uphill to enter another room (very difficult to walk in!) which has a few interesting things to try that work based on your sense of 'level' being skewed. You can put a ball on part of an upwards slanted pool table, which will then magically roll uphill and into the pocket! The table is actually one or two degrees sloped downhill, but your mind tells you it is sloped upwards due to the angle of the room itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the same room there is also a series of streams of water running into each other, which appear to be impossibly flowing uphill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ames room somehow makes you appear tiny in one corner, and huge in the other. I have absolutely no idea how it works, but it's really clever nonetheless! This technique was apparently used in The Lord of The Rings films, in order to make the actors playing the hobbits appear smaller than they actually are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541879360/" title="Wanaka-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8541879360_929fb8499f.jpg" alt="Wanaka-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hire a large boat to take you out on the lake somewhere. I'm not sure of the details exactly, but the reason I mention it is I was sitting by the lake one evening as it was returning and heard drunken shouts of "Three! Two! One! Wheeeeyy!" as a guy was chucked into the water by his mates. The funniest part (now looking back - not so much at the time) was observing this guy trying to swim to the shore - clearly struggling - before the captain of the boat deemed the situation serious enough to turn the boat around AND launch the fast dinghy off the back to go and pick him up. Let that be a lesson to you folks... go swimming when you're drunk. It's hilarious entertainment for the whole family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541917130/" title="Wanaka-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8541917130_c44ec97600.jpg" alt="Wanaka-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540814791/" title="Wanaka-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8540814791_81b0cd457a.jpg" alt="Wanaka-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541918434/" title="Wanaka-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8541918434_f8a32a0317.jpg" alt="Wanaka-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening I was treated to an amazing sunset, and more beautiful colours in the sky soon after, as it grew darker. Sunset, in my opinion beats sunrise any day of the week. But it could well be because I actually have to set my alarm to catch sunset... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540871813/" title="Wanaka-33 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8540871813_718e73c310.jpg" alt="Wanaka-33"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541975760/" title="Wanaka-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8090/8541975760_4f7d7dddfa.jpg" alt="Wanaka-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8720972220/" title="8540774771_1bf590378b_o_cropped by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/8720972220_9c6a1c8573.jpg" alt="8540774771_1bf590378b_o_cropped"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning things were ever so slightly rushed. I somehow managed to turn the alarm off on my phone and go back to sleep. When I eventually woke up, and looked at the time it was five minutes after when the coach was meant to be arriving to go to my next destination. This wouldn't have been quite so bad had it actually stopped at the hostel – but as Wanaka is so small, they just stop at the visitor's centre by the lakefront, five minutes' walk away. I quickly jumped out of bed, chucked all my stuff in my backpack and raced out the door, praying I hadn't missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn't look good. I arrived in the car park and it was empty. No coaches. I got my phone out and called Intercity, the coach company. "Was the coach from Wanaka to Fox Glacier running late at all?". "According to our information the coach was running on schedule Sir". Shit. Missed it. I was just contemplating stealing a car to race after it and intercept it further along the road, when I swung around and saw it turn the corner into the car park! Hoorah! I celebrated wildly by skipping around the car park gaily and throwing fresh flowers into the air, delighted that I had made it. Birds sang, tiny woodland animals clapped their paws in joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boarded the bus, and contentedly settled down into my seat for the journey. A couple of hours in, approaching a rest stop, I had literally just thought to myself "wow, how lucky was that?!", when I remembered I'd left my camera in the locker at the hostel.

Well that's exactly how it was for me! A short ride over to the platform, one guy who put things over my ankles, another guy who rigged everything up in the chair, then before I knew it I was standing at the edge ready to jump! "3, 2, 1" and then I just had to go didn't I? How embarrassing would that look if I didn't go first time?! I honestly wasn't terrified, nervous of course! - but I probably would have been a whole lot more nervous had the whole thing been dragged out! They obviously do that on purpose so you don't have time to think about it too much and potentially change your mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I booked it I picked an early time, one of the first for the day. As a result there were only three of us in my group, two girls and I. So of course, predictably, it ended up being me that jumped first as one of the bungy guys said something like "Luke will show you girls how it's done, won't you mate?". Oh. Thanks. Now I HAD to go first or I'd look like a pussy. Well played bungy guys. Once you are all hooked up you have to awkwardly shuffle over to the edge as your legs are bound together. There is a brief moment for you to think "What the actual feck am I doing?!" before looking around – and down – at the view before you. There's also a scary moment when the guy drops that big red thing, it's quite heavy and pulls you forward! It feels like you're about to get pulled off the edge, but he's holding you from behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8514673206/" title="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C2009_3543 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8098/8514673206_69e6173ab9.jpg" alt="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C2009_3543"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the dreaded countdown begins... then the dreaded countdown ends... and it's time to go! I sort of fell, rather than jumped off, but hey, at least I went! When you actually jump off it's a sensation like you've never experienced before, it's so hard to describe. But it's so fast, and it feels like your stomach is doing loops as you just drop from the sky! It's over in absolutely no time at all – you are so high up you have around eight seconds of freefall time, but it goes so quickly you'd never believe that was the case! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8514672770/" title="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C2009_3546 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8514672770_bb4bbd22c4.jpg" alt="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C2009_3546"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8513560775/" title="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C2009_3550 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8097/8513560775_155292eee3.jpg" alt="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C2009_3550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8514671078/" title="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C3009_3547 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8514671078_7c1629d9e6.jpg" alt="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C3009_3547"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8513559011/" title="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C4009_3548 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8371/8513559011_32170cdbb9.jpg" alt="AJHB_AJHN_2013_02_28_C4009_3548"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8520559258/" title="Queenstown-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/8520559258_b47f1dab32.jpg" alt="Queenstown-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you come up your adrenalin is pumping and I couldn't quite believe I'd actually just done it! If any of you are thinking about doing it, but need a little push... do it. Trust me, you won't regret it! And if you literally need a little push, I'm sure the bungy guys would be happy to oblige!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing that in the morning, the rest of the day seemed pretty mundane in comparison! Queenstown is a nice little town situated right by the water, which I always love. It's busier than the other places I'd been to but still relaxing enough to make it peaceful. Actually, come to think about it, it's the perfect place to chill after doing something as extreme as bungy jumping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536410466/" title="Queenstown-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8536410466_3b0049c8d7.jpg" alt="Queenstown-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536424020/" title="Queenstown-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8536424020_12e8408d6e.jpg" alt="Queenstown-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536431624/" title="Queenstown-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8536431624_6c907d2044.jpg" alt="Queenstown-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535332583/" title="Queenstown-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8535332583_77f57a2c7d.jpg" alt="Queenstown-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an interesting experience in the hostel that night, I was down in the TV lounge watching a movie, and when it ended I headed back to my dorm. Turning the key in the door, and swinging it open, the room was dark apart from some dim light through the windows – everyone tucked up in bed. I got my phone out to use the screen to see where I was going, walked over to my bunk, and found someone lying in my bed! Now if it had been a hot girl I would have been pretty happy, but it was some tall Japanese guy instead. Not impressed. He was still awake... "That's my bed!" I said... "Ohh, sowwy!"he replied, jumping out. I got in, to observe him in the faint light look around blankly and then walk out the door. The problem for him, was that the room was full and there were no more beds. Obviously why he'd decided mine was suitable... I don't know what happened to him after that, as thoughts of him and the double booking slipped from my mind as I drifted off to sleep, ready to wake up the following morning to leave for Wanaka.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/4362804423762442735/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/queenstown.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/4362804423762442735'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/4362804423762442735'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/queenstown.html' title='Queenstown'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/oeEXgapJugU/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7306719130241467632</id><published>2013-05-04T17:34:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-04T17:34:25.714+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Milford Sound'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Te Anau'/><title type='text'>Te Anau &amp; Milford Sound</title><content type='html'>Te Anau was where I'd originally intended to go simply for easy access to Milford Sound – which I'll get to later. But happily I found out it's also home to a glowworm cave. I'd spent hours trying to plan a route around the country which would take me through Waitomo – which is where another well known glowworm cave is located – only to find with the type of coach pass I had, the additional ticket there would have been extortionately expensive. I wrote it off as just one of those things I wouldn't be able to do on this particular trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea at the time about the one in Te Anau. Luckily I had enough time after arriving on the coach that day to go on one of their evening tours, before moving on the following morning. It all worked out very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the cave, you have to go for a short boat ride across Lake Te Anau, which was a nice enough experience in itself, especially at the time I went which was just around sunset – very pleasant views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540675971/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8540675971_8d04637a60.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541768442/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8541768442_68e75b1a6f.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541775224/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8541775224_d9cf9cd5a3.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540678059/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8540678059_858a81e7c2.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540680753/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8540680753_3e0d4ce86f.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there the photographs end – as cameras were prohibited inside the cave itself. This is because the flash can upset the glowworms, to the point where they refuse to work anymore and go on strike, extinguishing their glowing butts. You'll just have to take my word for it, when I tell you it's quite a magical experience looking up at a cave ceiling and seeing thousands of glowing "stars" instead of black nothingness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bit of the cave was really showcasing the stream running through it, at quite some force – with a short waterfall dropping as it flowed out to the lake beyond. Oh – they also proudly mentioned the first stalagtite found in the cave, and aged it around 400 years old. You could barely see it! I honestly could have squished it between my fingers and that would have been that. It really should get a move on... people are paying good money! There are a few glowworms in that section but not many, and you can't really see them as this part is well lit artificially. After walking slowly through this section on a manmade walkway to accommodate the tourists, you reach a small boat just big enough for the tour group you're in. After boarding, you're steered by the guide (using a stick along the bottom – no engine) in complete darkness on a dead still lake through the "Glowworm Grotto". You're asked to remain silent to contribute to the atmosphere (we actually heard a naughty group up ahead being shushed!), and as you slowly glide across the water you can see thousands upon thousands of tiny lights glowing on the ceiling in the darkness. It really is almost like looking up and seeing stars shining brightly in the night sky. Apparently some people are moved to tears... I didn't quite get to that stage, but it was pretty cool nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light from the glowworms is caused as a by-product of excretion. A reaction between chemicals takes place in their ass (I imagine this to be much like the after effects of a very strong curry) which produces the glow. The glowworm will dangle a "fishing line" down, up to 150mm long, which is covered in mucus (yum), and attracts insects which become stuck and paralysed by chemicals on the lines. The glowworm then pulls this in and consumes all the juices, sucking it dry (double yum). They're also very territorial and will quite happily turn to cannibalism and eat each other if a neighbour gets too close to their bit of the rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After exiting the cave, we boarded the boat again and returned to the dock. It was quite late by this point and I had intended to grab some food at a restaurant opposite, but it was closed. The pub next door was still open, but that had also stopped serving food apart from toasted sandwiches and things of that nature. Ever hopeful of finding somewhere still serving a proper meal, I wandered back in the direction of my hostel expecting to see other places – but everywhere was shut for the night. I couldn't be bothered walking back to the first pub with the sandwiches, so made do with the emergency pot noodles I carried with me in my food bag. Desperate times and all that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rising early the following morning, I wandered sleepily into the communal bathroom to have my usual shower. When I was done I opened the door to see a girl standing by one of the sinks doing her hair. "Morning" I said, "Morning"..... she replied, giving me a quizzical look. Turns out I was in the ladies bathroom. Completely unintentional of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out, and hopped aboard another bus leaving from Te Anau to Queenstown, via Milford Sound. The name of this is quite misleading, as it's not in fact a sound, but a fjord. The difference being, a sound is formed by water, whereas a fjord is formed by a glacier. We also stopped at the Mirror Lakes to stretch our legs on the way there, which was an impressive enough sight on its own. There were alpine parrots, native to New Zealand called kea's in the car park which had decided the bonnets and roofs of cars were the perfect place to sit and eat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540685881/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8540685881_be5cd7086a.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540697877/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8540697877_fa3fe4b07e.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milford Sound is two kilometres wide at its widest point, and surrounded by huge rockfaces on either side. Going out on the boat makes you feel very small indeed, as you are completely dwarfed by the sheer size of everything! Scenic tourist flights take place within the sound, and although these are obviously not very large planes in the first place – they do appear to be no more than tiny dots against the landscape as they're flying through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540762385/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8110/8540762385_e223dc6222.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540771839/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-31 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8540771839_838f826e05.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-31"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540700305/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8540700305_b9316712b2.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541866726/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8541866726_b29f9ff15f.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound is home to much wildlife, commonly spotted on the tours are fur seals hanging around on the rocks which were a big draw to the crowds on the boat. One of them in particular appeared to be performing some kind of water ballet for himself, spinning round slowly in circles with his flipper in the air. I'm sure he knew he was being photographed. We were also very lucky to see fiordland crested penguins swimming in the water at one point – which is apparently not very common at all, so that was a big bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540719627/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8540719627_43f360ae1c.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540715179/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8110/8540715179_2af922d48a.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541818838/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8541818838_febe1f1f34.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540722283/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8540722283_3eb12b5fe3.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8541822462/" title="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8541822462_78a2477967.jpg" alt="Te Anau &amp;amp; Milford Sound-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way back to the dock, we sailed very close to one of the waterfalls, and rainjackets were handed out for the brave souls who wanted to stand out the front of the boat as we did this!

I don't really have anything good to say about it..... it didn't break down? That has to be a plus! I have to say, it's the first time I've driven barefoot too... flip flops just weren't working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539068774/" title="The Catlins-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8094/8539068774_1b4f2802dd.jpg" alt="The Catlins-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8666681402/" title="Camera Roll-543 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8666681402_7da96edd68.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-543"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the car from Dunedin and drove straight down to Owaka, a tiny village near the south east coast. I was staying in a hostel there as the base for my adventures around the area. Due to the distance between the sights, a hire car really was the only option for me. That's the only problem with coaches – they're the cheapest way by far, but they don't always go where you want them to, and you certainly don't have as much freedom as you'd like (exploring sideroads, stopping to take photos etc). And this was definitely an area where you needed to be able to stop to take photos...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537127803/" title="The Catlins-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8537127803_8f46ae7b24.jpg" alt="The Catlins-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537120981/" title="The Catlins-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8091/8537120981_6ec112f35b.jpg" alt="The Catlins-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537134399/" title="The Catlins-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8537134399_88a6908a3d.jpg" alt="The Catlins-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537140087/" title="The Catlins-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8537140087_e436cedc94.jpg" alt="The Catlins-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8538259226/" title="The Catlins-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8538259226_6ab004d80a.jpg" alt="The Catlins-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537991691/" title="Catlins 2-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8537991691_d0b8f71edf.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539004554/" title="The Catlins-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8505/8539004554_5b400bffb2.jpg" alt="The Catlins-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539837357/" title="Catlins 2-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8532/8539837357_84d646c9fc.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540909834/" title="Catlins 2-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/8540909834_9011fb4cbe.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself rounding a corner and actually saying "wow" on more than one occasion. Actually I was pretty glad not to have a nice car of my own when driving on some of those roads... quite a few of them were just dirt and rocks! At the very best, if your car wasn't covered in millions of scratches, dents and stonechips, it would be completely filthy and dusty after every drive. I couldn't handle that, my cars need to be constantly clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few waterfalls available for my viewing pleasure along the main coastal road in The Catlins. Purakaunui Falls (I have no idea how that's pronounced either) was the first one I arrived at and looked pretty impressive from the photos I'd seen, so I decided that would be the one I visited. I wasn't entirely sure how long my journey would be that day and I wanted to make sure I had enough time to get to the things near the end of the route and then get back to my hostel in time to cook some dinner, so I decided just to stop at that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537003421/" title="The Catlins-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8537003421_d0f45ca947.jpg" alt="The Catlins-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537909833/" title="The Catlins-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8537909833_7b3bcea21e.jpg" alt="The Catlins-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was smaller than some of the others I'd seen while I was away, but it was in a nicely wooded area and very picturesque, I was pleased with the photos I managed to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further down the road I arrived at Slope Point, the southernmost point on the South Island. Don't believe me?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8538010025/" title="Catlins 2-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8538010025_d125fed09b.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539109474/" title="Catlins 2-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8366/8539109474_5c8c17177d.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539113632/" title="Catlins 2-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8539113632_8e1dc242c0.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540618296/" title="Catlins 2-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8540618296_00e8086875.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as you might expect – being so close to the coast, the wind can sometimes pick up a bit. But I had absolutely no idea this could happen as a result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540663692/" title="Catlins 2-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8540663692_c7123e534d.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539552231/" title="Catlins 2-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8539552231_4f30fc34ca.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've only ever seen "normal" trees. Do we have trees like this back in England?! I haven't seen them if so... maybe someone can let me know in the comments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued driving through gorgeous countryside and winding coastal road, congratulating myself on making such a brilliant decision to hire a car and go down there! It was very quiet too, not too many tourists around – they were still there but not in huge numbers, which was nice. I guess because it was slightly more inaccessible than other places (unless you had your own transportation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaching Kaka Point, I parked the car up and walked ten minutes along a path winding around the cliffs to a lighthouse, which overlooked the "Nuggets". These are rocks just off the coast, which, when you see the pics you'll probably agree are aptly named.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537177931/" title="The Catlins-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8091/8537177931_e1e122ca2c.jpg" alt="The Catlins-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537208897/" title="The Catlins-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8537208897_843285419c.jpg" alt="The Catlins-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537726501/" title="The Catlins-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8537726501_31f117fd13.jpg" alt="The Catlins-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing down the coast (again stopping for more photo opportunities!)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8537731817/" title="The Catlins-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8537731817_ff54b7a533.jpg" alt="The Catlins-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8538268164/" title="The Catlins-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8538268164_df75749415.jpg" alt="The Catlins-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8538274138/" title="The Catlins-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8538274138_0cc5102cf3.jpg" alt="The Catlins-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I reached my turnaround point, Waipapa Point, which I was looking forward to as it promised the best chance along the way to encounter sealions on the beach. You're warned not to go too close to them, but a few metres away is fine so as not to disturb them, but still get some great photos. I reached the beach and wasn't disappointed! A couple of sealions were waiting for me, along with a another lighthouse to make a nice photo... the perfect end before turning back for the day to cook some dinner, and then pack my bag for my early drive back to Dunedin the following morning, to catch the coach to Te Anau!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539843137/" title="Catlins 2-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8385/8539843137_38a2802e00.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539889935/" title="Catlins 2-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8539889935_6237db7d8c.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I thought it was dead at first too... turns out it's just lazy...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8539883989/" title="Catlins 2-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8097/8539883989_3a9e77440b.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8540959922/" title="Catlins 2-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8505/8540959922_bea15c8d40.jpg" alt="Catlins 2-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/415925399008665967/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-catlins.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/415925399008665967'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/415925399008665967'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-catlins.html' title='The Catlins'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-430850470418599125</id><published>2013-04-30T21:00:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-30T21:00:04.893+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Dunedin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Dunedin</title><content type='html'>Dunedin has a chocolate factory! Once I discovered that I dropped everything and rushed there immediately! Well not quite... but it went on my to do list that's for sure.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The chances of getting to Dunedin didn't actually look too great initially. I guess I was fairly lucky with the coach trips I'd previously had along the way, there'd been no breakdowns - which for Southeast Asia I think was a small miracle. But that was all about to change on the way to Dunedin...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I boarded the coach as per usual with all the other passengers. It was smaller than usual, and definitely older, but nothing obviously wrong with it. We got underway, and had maybe an hour or two of happy motoring before the driver pulled over to the side of the road for no apparent reason. The engine stopped, and no amount of trying would get it started again. To complicate matters, we were in an area where there was no phone signal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driver took it upon himself to pluck a lucky kiwi "volunteer" from the group of passengers, settling on what appeared to be a 15 year old kid. He flagged down a small truck going in our direction and sent the kid off with him to the next town to get help or petrol (one of the prime suspects - but without a working petrol gauge, it wasn't guaranteed!). Apparently the driver couldn't go as he had to stay with the coach for insurance reasons?! I reckon it was laziness, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After maybe forty minutes, the kid returned with another guy and a jerry can full of fuel. This was dumped into the tank, and we all rejoiced as on the second or third attempt the engine coughed back into life again! We continued on.....for about 2km, before spluttering to a halt again further down the road! Cue mass groans from the passengers. The driver hopped out, and knocked on the door of a nearby house to use their phone. Ten minutes later a mechanic in a tow truck arrived with two more jerry cans full of fuel. These were also poured into the tank, and once again cheers and clapping (although rather more tentative this time around) when the engine started up once again. We made it to the next town, filled up the tank at the petrol station and luckily had no more problems from then on! It's funny how much better an engine runs with fuel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was in town there was a big rugby match going on between the Chiefs (the reigning champions) and the Highlanders (home ground in Dunedin). I'll openly admit I just had to google that information as I haven't the slightest interest in rugby whatsoever! It's just lucky I'd booked ahead after my Christchurch experience though, as a few people in my hostel were in town for the game and I heard a few people getting turned away while I was stating there due to it being fully booked. Oh, the Highlanders lost - in case you were interested. Coincidentally I also happened to be walking back to my hostel on the night of the game when out of a posh hotel/casino in front of me a load of rugby-looking types trailed out and into a waiting coach. Presumably the team (no idea which one) on their way to the game! Exciting stuff! Well, not for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8666689196/" title="Camera Roll-541 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8666689196_94e6d9e6a6.jpg"   alt="Camera Roll-541"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As usual, I did my little walking tour around the city to take in all the sights and smells. It's quite a nice place and can also claim the country's most photographed building - the Dunedin Railway Station. This did used to be the busiest station in New Zealand, handling over one hundred trains per day. You can certainly see why it is the building most photographed (although I have no idea how they actually determine this?!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8520582642/" title="Dunedin-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8520582642_33d0a0dedd.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524476236/" title="Dunedin-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8524476236_7e7e1d0180.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524494554/" title="Dunedin-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8524494554_4f429d87aa.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8520610678/" title="Dunedin-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8520610678_efac99fa9d.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8522745369/" title="Dunedin-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8522745369_01668f7ec6.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8523375217/" title="Dunedin-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8523375217_be750e6f7e.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524502188/" title="Dunedin-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8524502188_e36e015bc2.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8523411559/" title="Dunedin-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8523411559_3e66545dd0.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I visited the Cadbury's factory after this. Now I like chocolate... I'm not obsessed with it or anything, it's not like it's a pizza factory (which would be my idea of heaven), but it's still a place that I can definitely enjoy... a lot. Especially when you're provided with multiple free bars of chocolate as you're escorted around the factory by one of the guides. Especially when you get to dip your whole head in a pool of molten chocolate and drink as much as you possibly can (OK I made that last one up). Unfortunately cameras were not allowed - as the flash scares the oompa loompas. It was cool to see just how the things are made though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the whole factory runs three different coloured pipes suspended from the ceiling. It's within these pipes the molten chocolate flows to each different area to be used as necessary. One pipe is for milk chocolate, one for dark and one for white. The outside of the pipe is double skinned, allowing hot water to flow around the outside of the inner pipe holding the chocolate. This ensures it remains hot and keeps flowing through the pipework. Apparently every now and then something could go wrong with this system (maybe once a year), which cools the water and the chocolate hardens in the pipes. This causes 24hours downtime while the pipework is removed and cleared before everything can get back up and running.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8523399039/" title="Dunedin-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8373/8523399039_33553d1149.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524519688/" title="Dunedin-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8524519688_98235868c5.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8523403547/" title="Dunedin-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8523403547_ae0a652118.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We arrived in the huge area where they make and fill the Roses boxes. You really wouldn't believe the size of the machine they have just to put some chocolates in a box... it's takes up most of the space on that floor. She also said that they can't guarantee the number of "heavy" chocolates in each box (fudge, caramels etc) rather than the cremes that everybody leaves till last, but I reckon she's lying and it's all one big hold-back-one-fudge-from-every-box-to-make-us-an-extra-million-per-year strategy!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We did get to try the molten chocolate that they use to fill Smarties (or Pebbles as they were called there for some reason), but only a small cardboard test pot full. She then led us into the cooling tower you can see in the outside photos, where a giant chocolate fountain is held. 100 gallons of liquid chocolate are dropped from a great height into a huge vat below - quite an impressive sight! That is all it is though - apparently it was installed purely for the tourist's benefit, it serves no purpose (other than splashing the surrounding area with tiny drops of chocolate)! This forms quite a skin on all the stairs and handrails by the end of the day, which the staff then need to clear down and drop back into circulation to keep the 100 gallon weight the same, or the fountain will no longer drop. The only photos were allowed outside the building of the old vehicles they used to use when it was still a relatively small operation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524517994/" title="Dunedin-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8524517994_01acca3e24.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Dunedin is also home to some of the steepest roads you've ever seen. In fact, one of them is so steep it's made the Guinness Book of Records, at a gradient of 1 in 2.86 - which means absolutely nothing to me either! So have some pics after I "climbed" it!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524526190/" title="Dunedin-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8524526190_010fb7decf.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8523422459/" title="Dunedin-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8523422459_6422723f1f.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8524540504/" title="Dunedin-27 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8527/8524540504_5ca6005495.jpg"   alt="Dunedin-27"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There were more crazies here running up and down the road training. Why would you torture yourself like that?! This one girl literally looked like she was about to collapse in exhaustion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually at this point in the blog I would be jumping aboard a coach to get to my next destination, but this time for where I wanted to go – a hire car was needed. I'll make you wait in huge suspense till the next post to find out just which car I decided on.... Ferrari? Porsche? Lamborghini? All will be revealed... in The Catlins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/430850470418599125/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/dunedin.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/430850470418599125'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/430850470418599125'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/dunedin.html' title='Dunedin'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1414263768412558502</id><published>2013-04-28T13:00:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-28T13:00:00.119+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mount Cook'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Mount Cook</title><content type='html'>Mount Cook (as you would probably expect), is pretty darn big. Like, mountain big. Arriving on the coach, you can see it looming in the distance and it's really quite astounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487884209/" title="Mount Cook-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8487884209_7e2b9d5061.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived in the early afternoon, and I hadn't originally intended to go out - rather stay in the hostel and write some of my blog (I think you can guess how well that went while I was in New Zealand, as you're still getting updates now I'm back home!). There was no way I could stay inside with a view like this calling to me though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488965588/" title="Mount Cook-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8488965588_11320828e0.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped off at the visitor centre, and discovered the Hooker Valley track was still easily do-able that afternoon. Apparently it's frequented by classy ladies in 6" clear heels every few hundred metres. I packed up my bag and eagerly headed off in that direction...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The track goes right to the edge of the glacier, where a lake has formed and chunks of ice which have broken off the edge can be seen floating in the water. While I was walking, I saw two crazy things. Crazy thing number one was a guy in flip flops... now I virtually lived in flip flops while I was away, but trust me, this wasn't a track you wanted to be doing  that in. Crazy thing number two was people running along it. Mentalists. Anyway, the view at the end was just brilliant, with the reflection of the mountain in the (nearly) still lake. I stayed for as long as I could, before having to return to make sure I got back before dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487677651/" title="Mount Cook-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8487677651_23be9b388e.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488982880/" title="Mount Cook-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8488982880_bcbfa10654.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487685741/" title="Mount Cook-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8487685741_97ef6d88bd.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487681981/" title="Mount Cook-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8487681981_fc64e51d6a.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd worked up quite an appetite, and I decided to treat myself to a quality meal at a grill I'd walked past earlier on in the day. I was on my way there, when a car pulled up and a couple asked for directions, coincidentally to the same restaurant I was walking to. They kindly offered me a lift, and I accepted, having always been advised to both take sweets and get into cars with strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two abductors - Denise and Dave - and I sat down to eat our meals with refreshing beverages to wash them down. Turns out they were both police officers and were in New Zealand on their honeymoon, travelling around the south island in a car. They had not intended to go to Mount Cook originally but changed their plans last minute, and had just arrived when I saw them. I told them they made a great decision! The decision to go to the grill wasn't bad either,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489501603/" title="Camera Roll-538 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8524/8489501603_3a34db35a3.jpg"  height="374" alt="Camera Roll-538"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;They could have got more ribs on the plate if it wasn't for that strange green stuff on the side...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day, I walked another shorter trail to Kea Point, which gives a good view of the glacier, and got accosted by Chinese tourists for photos! Not just to take photos for them... having done that I was also dragged in to have my photo taken too! Still, they bribed me with cherries and sweets so I wasn't complaining in the slightest. No photos of them sadly, but here's the view from Kea Point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489003762/" title="Mount Cook-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8385/8489003762_01e97da8c6.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487904515/" title="Mount Cook-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8487904515_7e00a57e16.jpg"   alt="Mount Cook-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way back, I decided to tackle the Sealy Tarns track. This one was going to be a little tougher though... 1810 steps up the side of a mountain to give an even better view of the area! I knew it would hurt as I'd become very unfit and not done any real exercise (other than walking EVERYWHERE) but I knew I had to do it! I'm so glad I did.

It just had to be done. With a full stomach, I returned to my Mount Cook hostel for the final night, and prepared for my journey to Dunedin the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1414263768412558502/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/mount-cook.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1414263768412558502'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1414263768412558502'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/mount-cook.html' title='Mount Cook'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-449855905719978193</id><published>2013-04-27T23:33:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-27T23:33:53.478+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lake Tekapo'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><title type='text'>Lake Tekapo</title><content type='html'>I arrived on the coach and walked a short distance to my hostel, leaving my bag there for a few hours as it was still too early to check-in. After exploring for a while, I went back and tried to check in, but the girl on the reception desk was struggling to find me. "Are you sure you booked this hostel?", she politely asked. I checked my reservation email. Turns out I was in the wrong one! Just another day in the life of a capable, experienced backpacker...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did arrive in the hostel I'd actually booked, I walked into the dorm, dumped my bag and there was a girl asleep in one of the bunks. She woke as I entered and the very first words she uttered to me - no "hi" or anything - was "have you got a cigarette?". No. No I don't have a cigarette you impolite moocher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake Tekapo is a huge draw for tourists due to the stunning turquoise colour of the water. This is caused by 'glacial flour' suspended in the water, which is produced by rocks grinding together and producing a very fine powder as they are dragged down by glaciers in the alps. The resulting effect is quite remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487927213/" title="Lake Tekapo-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8487927213_6dbb6138e6.jpg" alt="Lake Tekapo-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489071138/" title="Lake Tekapo-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8489071138_9f9d919f3f.jpg" alt="Lake Tekapo-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487971927/" title="Lake Tekapo-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8487971927_9ba509cb71.jpg" alt="Lake Tekapo-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489031582/" title="Lake Tekapo-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8489031582_390af64e2b.jpg" alt="Lake Tekapo-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you walk around you can't fail to notice the huge amount of asian tourists everywhere! Evidently New Zealand in particular is high on the list of places to visit, and quite frankly I can see why! Everywhere you look, even on the coach in between places you're blown away by the scenery, it really is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the lake was undeniably beautiful, once I'd seen it and walked around for a bit I felt like I'd done all I needed to do there. There's not an awful lot else to see in the immediate area. I believe there are other trails for hiking, but I was pacing myself for treks I had planned for later in the trip! I did get to see a statue of a collie... I bet none of you can claim that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487974641/" title="Lake Tekapo-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8487974641_180bfe52c1.jpg" alt="Lake Tekapo-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning I was due to leave, I was waiting for my coach as per usual, when one pulled into the carpark bound for a different destination. Nothing unusual there, I was being patient and waiting for mine which was still due. But someone else waiting for the same bus as me asked the driver that had just arrived where the other coach was. He said he'd seen it pass him at a stop he'd made back down the road. This caused mass panic and many phonecalls from the driver to dispatch in an attempt to locate the other coach. It turns out all that mayhem was for nothing as the other coach calmly pulled up five minutes later. The other passengers and I boarded, and relaxed into our seats as we headed off in the direction of Mount Cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/449855905719978193/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/lake-tekapo.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/449855905719978193'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/449855905719978193'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/lake-tekapo.html' title='Lake Tekapo'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5097118943634671294</id><published>2013-04-25T20:48:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-25T20:48:24.851+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Zealand'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Christchurch'/><title type='text'>Christchurch, New Zealand</title><content type='html'>New Zealand and I didn't get off to the best of starts. I nearly didn't get into the country due to an extremely unfriendly security agent. Usually, I hand over my passport, they give me a suspicious stare, stamp it/ scan it and send me on my way. This guy wanted to see proof of my intention to leave the country. I had nothing on me, but I managed to find an old pdf itinerary from the travel agent on my phone and showed him that – but that made him even more suspicious as it had the wrong date on for my flight out of New Zealand – one that had already passed. This is because when I bought my round-the-world plane ticket, it was more than a year in advance of when I would actually be arriving – and the airlines don't release their flight information this far ahead. Therefore, they had to book the flights towards the end of my trip on arbitrary dates like the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th September for example. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He then began quizzing me relentlessly while I searched through my long list of old emails to try and find the one with the new itinerary from the travel agent when I'd changed the dates for the flights. "How long will you be staying in the country?", "Six weeks" I replied, "That's a long time isn't it? When did you last take drugs, marijuana etc?". Great, so now I'm a druggie or a dealer... I finally found the email I needed, and was waved through in order for him to begin preying on his next victim. It didn't end there though, I was waiting for my bag at the conveyor belt (the only flight I had to check my bag for – usually I could get it on as hand luggage) when a lady with a sniffer dog came up to me, sniffed me (the dog, not her) and proceeded to ask me all the same questions the last guy had (her, not the dog). I clearly look a lot more suspicious than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally made it out of the airport, and boarded the bus to take me into Christchurch town centre. The problem is, I think I got my priorities slightly wrong when I made my plans for Christchurch back in Australia. I'd searched for the nearest mobile phone shop where I could go and get my 3G sim card as I usually do in each place, which worked out perfectly. I had internet and could make all the calls I needed... the problem was, all the hostels I phoned had no spare beds! So I was well connected, just... homeless. Luck was on my side however, after phoning about five different places the next one I called had a space available and I thankfully made my way there using google maps with my new sim card! I'll mention at this point, that I have no idea how people managed before google maps. I honestly think I'd be hopelessly lost, sleeping in a gutter somewhere in Vietnam without it. I resolved to book my bed in advance for all of the places I was visiting in New Zealand, to avoid the same fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things I saw when I was walking to my hostel was a drunken man with a large bottle of wine in his hand, shouting loudly at a lad behind him on the phone to "f off". The young lad in a shop uniform ignored him, and continued following him down the road talking on his mobile. The whole situation was drawing quite a crowd, as they slowly followed even further behind, observing from a safe distance. I think what must have happened is the drunk guy stole the bottle from a liquor shop and proceeded to drink it as he was leaving the scene of the crime. It was certainly one of the most interesting arrivals I've had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christchurch is know as the garden city – but following a severe earthquake in 2011, which killed 185 people, it could now quite easily be called the rubble city. There is a 'red zone' in the city centre which is cordoned off from the public, due to the high risk presented by unstable buildings in the aftermath of the earthquake. What surprised me is just how little appears to have been (deliberately) demolished or even rebuilt in the time between then and now. There is still a very large zone in the city centre that is completely off limits to the public, and no sign that will change anytime in the near future. It actually is pretty creepy in a lot of places as plants are growing over the pavements and walls of the buildings, giving the appearance of some kind of ghosttown in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488723870/" title="Christchurch-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8488723870_136da4fbb5.jpg" alt="Christchurch-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488728298/" title="Christchurch-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8488728298_041f91e2c3.jpg" ="Christchurch-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488679480/" title="Christchurch-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8488679480_a9be655e10.jpg" alt="Christchurch-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487623485/" title="Christchurch-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8487623485_3ac7be60ec.jpg" ="Christchurch-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487615977/" title="Christchurch-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8487615977_e96401025b.jpg" alt="Christchurch-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487619909/" title="Christchurch-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8487619909_9d59e38ded.jpg" alt="Christchurch-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488946120/" title="Christchurch-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8488946120_50b2038be2.jpg" ="Christchurch-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487849515/" title="Christchurch-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8091/8487849515_b90f7440af.jpg" ="Christchurch-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;After...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was staying at the hostel they showed a very good documentary called "When a City Falls", which was all filmed by one man, a Christchurch resident during and after the earthquakes. It focuses on the people of Christchurch and how they are all reacting to the disaster. Of course some people have moved on to live elsewhere, afraid of what may lie ahead in future for the inhabitants of the city, but the overwhelming majority have pulled together to clean up, rebuild, and get on with their lives as best they can. It's quite inspiring to see just how people can pull together like that in such a time of crisis. The scary thing is, since the first earthquake in 2010, there have been over 1600 tremors in total – a constant reminder of exactly how dangerous it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound of diggers fills your ears as you skirt the perimeter fence, as rubble is moved and walls are collapsed. But there really aren't many workers – I can see why there appears to be so little change. It's very sad to think what it could have been like and to see it now, but there are of course plans to rebuild and make the best out of such a tragic situation. There are posters up which outline the plans the council has to completely restructure the city and create new districts. I admire the resiliance of the people in Christchurch and I'd love to return at some point in the future just to see how things have changed since I was there last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the rubble and destruction around the red zone, there are still very pleasant places to go outside of that area. With a river running through the city lined with trees and nice parks around you're never far from a perfect picnic lunch spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487833185/" title="Christchurch-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8487833185_668aa7d739.jpg" alt="Christchurch-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488932702/" title="Christchurch-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8488932702_b9a85a892b.jpg" alt="Christchurch-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8490576992/" title="Christchurch-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8490576992_d3c0936a7f.jpg" alt="Christchurch-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As soon as I sat down, ducks began flocking to me in the hope of some food...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487595077/" title="Christchurch-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8487595077_264db2b448.jpg" alt="Christchurch-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has also been an innovative new high street built, with all the shops and food places built inside shipping containers. A very clever idea and I actually think it looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488920060/" title="Christchurch-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8488920060_5d9af73045.jpg" alt="Christchurch-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488913404/" title="Christchurch-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8229/8488913404_a8c377b2b5.jpg" alt="Christchurch-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488916324/" title="Christchurch-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8488916324_abdb0c260c.jpg" alt="Christchurch-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess someone had the idea when they saw how many were lying around the city being used as supports for buildings in the red zone... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487658381/" title="Christchurch-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8487658381_dffb058175.jpg" alt="Christchurch-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488731184/" title="Christchurch-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8488731184_2fff981f80.jpg" alt="Christchurch-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488909190/" title="Christchurch-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8488909190_b193808d27.jpg" alt="Christchurch-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another idea born out of pure creativity – a welcome side effect of the disaster – is a community bookswap, found on a street corner where residents can go to drop off an old book and pick up a new one they fancy reading. Little touches like this just show the community spirit still evident in Christchurch and make me feel confident for the future of the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488947670/" title="Christchurch-30 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8488947670_6fee3b8c21.jpg" alt="Christchurch-30"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was leaving for my next destination on the coach, the driver pointed out a modern, fresh looking building to us, that was completely empty and had notices plastered all over the doors and walls outside. We were told that after the earthquake it had been completely renovated and made good, I'm sure at considerable expense – only for the foundations to have been inspected months ago and the structural engineers saying it must be demolished as it was unsafe. I can only imagine how heart breaking it must have been to receive that news. We left it far in the distance, as my thoughts turned to Lake Tekapo, my next destination.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/5097118943634671294/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/christchurch-new-zealand.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5097118943634671294'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5097118943634671294'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/christchurch-new-zealand.html' title='Christchurch, New Zealand'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7943272896828458574</id><published>2013-04-23T21:11:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-23T21:11:52.031+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Melbourne'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'>Melbourne</title><content type='html'>I did something pretty idiotic at the airport flying from Sydney to Melbourne. I wasn't going to include this in the blog, as it makes me look like an utter retard, but I reckon you would all enjoy laughing at my stupidity. See how nice I am to you guys?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my defence – the flight was very early in the morning (read: cheap), and I was still half asleep. Ok, now I've made my excuses... I arrived at the airport and walked into the hall with all the check-in desks. I looked at the nearest monitor, to see where I needed to go to to check in for my flight. 38a..... perfect. I walked all the way along the desks looking at the numbers, but they only went up to 36 or something like that. That's odd, I thought. I asked the nearest attendant where 38a was. "Through security and straight ahead". Odd, why are the other desks in a different place? I wondered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded through security, having my scissors thrown away in the process, ate my customary (healthy) McDonalds breakfast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489278622/" title="Sydney-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8489278622_e1d8677e3d.jpg" alt="Sydney-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And wandered down to the gate. GATE 38a. No check-in desks down at the gate funnily enough. I was directed back whence I'd came, out into the hall I started in, walked along the desks again looking more closely at the screens above them, only to find two lonely Tiger Airways desks nestled in amongst Qantas and Jetstar. Checked in, went through security AGAIN, and walked back down to the gate AGAIN. I do worry about myself sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "hostel" I stayed at in Melbourne came highly recommended on the review sites I use. The Bendigo Hotel is conveniently located near to a train station to easily get into the town center, cheap, lots of friendly people running it, and above a pub... ahhhhh ok, now I see why it's so popular. It really was good though, it's not your stereotypical hostel as it's just a couple of dorms above the pub with some shared facilities. But a lot of the people staying there are working in the area or even in the bar downstairs at nights. It was a very cool place with live music at night, and a  really friendly, family atmosphere with the owners. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was in Melbourne I was keen to visit the Great Ocean Road, particularly The Twelve Apostles. This meant hiring a car as it was some way out of Melbourne, but still the closest place to it. Damn you Australia for being so big! It wasn't all bad news though... I got to drive this BEAST of a car for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8671388007/" title="IMG_6740 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8671388007_30c3554a1c.jpg" alt="IMG_6740"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a Nissan Micra with a 6 litre, 500bhp engine inside. It can reach 0-60 in 1 second and pushes 200mph (I wished). I picked the car up in the afternoon and drove straight down to the Twelve Apostles to get there for sunset and the best photo opportunity. The astute amongst you will notice there are considerably less than twelve apostles left now – that's due to the others being claimed by the sea as the limestone rock is steadily eroded. In fact, that's how the apostles were formed in the first place – the sea slowly erodes the rock either side of them, then behind as it pushes further up the beach – the harder rock in the column takes longer which leaves it stood in the middle of the sea while the rest of the coastline recedes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488228513/" title="Melbourne-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8488228513_869a0eaa70.jpg" alt="Melbourne-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488224467/" title="Melbourne-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8488224467_970f2889c5.jpg" alt="Melbourne-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my hanging around there until well after sunset, by the time I made it to my hostel they'd shut up shop for the night and it was fairly late when I arrived. Luckily I'd phoned beforehand and they'd stuck my entrance card in an envelope on the front door, and I was able to get in and grab some sleep before getting up extra early the following morning, this time for sunrise! I think it's probably the shortest length of time I've ever spent in a hostel! Sunrise was nice, but in my opinion not quite as pretty as sunset. I was glad I'd made it down in time the previous day to catch that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8490551308/" title="Melbourne-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8490551308_e40dc06e8c.jpg" alt="Melbourne-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8490555108/" title="Melbourne-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8490555108_55c6e7d7bc.jpg" alt="Melbourne-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enjoying sunrise, I had the enjoyable task of driving back to Melbourne via the Great Ocean Road, in beautiful sunshine and clear blue skies. Even the woefully underpowered Nissan Micra couldn't get me down with a road that nice to drive along, it was incredible. I would love to do it again in a nice car or on a motorbike, that would be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8672779303/" title="IMG_6728 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8114/8672779303_87ee4a245f.jpg" alt="IMG_6728"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8672780339/" title="IMG_6725 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8403/8672780339_283a721459.jpg" alt="IMG_6725"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8673878548/" title="IMG_6745 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8673878548_86a6d46a60.jpg" alt="IMG_6745"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8672776115/" title="IMG_6747 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8125/8672776115_12dda9648a.jpg" alt="IMG_6747"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point along the road, there's a lighthouse which you can visit, and the sideroad on the way to it has a reputation as being the place to spot koala bears in the wild. Sure enough, a short drive in that direction and I soon saw a few cars pulled over by the side of the road, with a horde of eager tourists snapping away at the treetops with their cameras. I had seen koalas before at the sanctuary in Brisbane, but not yet in their natural habitat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8672781779/" title="IMG_6711 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8672781779_6b5cd428a1.jpg" alt="IMG_6711"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8673884010/" title="IMG_6709 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8673884010_54edba5887.jpg" alt="IMG_6709"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was warned not to stand directly under them, as apparently they've been known to poo on unsuspecting tourists. Welcome to Australia! Have some poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Melbourne, and what is quite possibly my favourite place so far. It’s not any one thing that causes me to say that, it’s just a very pleasant place to spend time in. It’s very clean, nice architecture, easily to walk around in the town centre – but still with good public transport if you do need it. Felt safe at night wandering around, and nice being down by the south bank at night with all the street performers and bars. Oh, and the street art is something else! It’s actually legal, and commissioned by the government in dedicated lanes around the city centre. How cool is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8490290810/" title="Melbourne-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img

another tick in the box for Melbourne as far as I’m concerned! It’s not the nicest beach I’ve been to so far in Australia, but hey, it’s a beach. And it’s a damn sight better than Brighton beach in the UK anyway... I was there for sunset too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489163691/" title="Melbourne-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8513/8489163691_356560b539.jpg" alt="Melbourne-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489157873/" title="Melbourne-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8489157873_205a797805.jpg" alt="Melbourne-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8490266264/" title="Melbourne-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8490266264_7cc474dd35.jpg" alt="Melbourne-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489186161/" title="Melbourne-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8489186161_c6f1cb13cc.jpg" alt="Melbourne-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My flight out of Melbourne was at stupid o’ clock in the morning again, something like 6am. I had intended to get an early night to get plenty of sleep for it, but that went out the window when I got dragged out of bed by one of the guys working and staying in the hostel to celebrate his 18th birthday. Of course this couldn’t be ignored! I didn’t protest too much anyway...! We spent the night with all of the other "housemates" down in the bar playing pool and drinking (among other things) free birthday shots poured by the owners due to it being a birthday. Very cool place indeed.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/7943272896828458574/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/melbourne.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7943272896828458574'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7943272896828458574'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/04/melbourne.html' title='Melbourne'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-3502880034107790797</id><published>2013-04-22T13:30:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-22T17:30:57.807+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sydney'/><title type='text'>Sydney</title><content type='html'>Sydney! This was the milestone. Finally get to see my friends Ollie and Emma, over Christmas and New Year, and spend some time in just one place for a little while! It's funny how normal it can start to seem flitting from place to place after a while. A stop-off in one place is definitely what was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived late at night, after a thirteen hour bus ride from Byron Bay. I'll just say there are definitely nicer ways of spending that amount of time... and in the darkness I almost missed the official sign welcoming me to the city, a dimly lit Opera House in the middle of the harbour! Welcome to Sydney!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great to see Ollie and Emma again after such a long time. Of course a visit to a drinking establishment was in order, to celebrate my arrival without any significant damage to my person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8393163321/" title="Camera Roll-455 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8213/8393163321_3c55af888a.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-455"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Emma's first comments on seeing me was "Luke, you're so brown!". I'm usually a fetching shade of pasty white, so hearing this was quite a novelty! The sunny weather obviously agrees with me. It's not like we get that much of it in the UK. I left the country and to punish the rest of you for letting me leave, mother nature sent rain.... and lots of it. However, while sunny weather agrees with me, 41 degree heat certainly doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8394227470/" title="Camera Roll-550 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8394227470_fd7295e899.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously think I melted a bit. You know how on a very hot day you usually welcome a nice cooling, refreshing breeze? On that occasion even the wind was hot. It was like someone had opened the oven door and blasted a wall of heat at your face. That day had us running for cover to the nearest building with an aircon unit, where we didn't move for quite some time. It just may have been a public house.... I forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following couple of weeks thankfully weren't so hot, but it was still great weather for the many things we had planned while I was there. One of the first places we visited was Cockatoo Island, which used to be a naval dockyard and shipbuilding facility. There are still lots of cool abandoned industrial machines and warehouses to explore, and I loved taking photos there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8363166940/" title="Snapseed-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8463/8363166940_175b6bce3f.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Snapseed-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8363163242/" title="Snapseed-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8329/8363163242_9168af79cf.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Snapseed-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8363153730/" title="Snapseed-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8497/8363153730_301ae57ec8.jpg" alt="Snapseed-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8362292155/" title="Camera Roll-537 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8358/8362292155_2a5eef0769.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-537"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8393139643/" title="Camera Roll-548 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8325/8393139643_f10fe427ec.jpg" width="329" height="500" alt="Camera Roll-548"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;All credit to Max for this shot. I think it captures mine and Ollie's model side perfectly...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another short ferry ride from the main harbour lies Manly, a very popular seaside location which draws a huge number of people on hot, sunny days. Although we did briefly sit on the beach and enjoy the sun for a while, our main objective here was to visit The Lord Nelson and Four Pines breweries. We spent the rest of the day there getting acquainted with the delicious craft beers on offer! You may notice a theme here... it's just a shame that while the beer at these places is extremely good, it's not quite sold at Southeast Asian prices! Our (or rather, my) amusement for the day came about as Ollie was walking around the ferry on our way there. The strap on his flip flop (thong, if you're Australian) literally fell apart, meaning he had to walk around barefoot like a hobo until we found a shop that sold suitable replacements. It was a hot day, which also meant hot pavements... Ollie nearly running when crossing the road to get to some shade did thoroughly amuse me, especially after my ordeal on the sand on Fraser Island!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Mountains (confusingly enough) are not actually blue. The name lies in the appearance given by the blue mist that is emitted by the millions of Eucalyptus trees in the area on hot days. This gives a faint blue appearance to the mountains from a distance, hence the name. Whatever the reason, the view was quite wonderful, and as with most of my photos, cannot truly be depicted in print. It is always far more spectacular in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8487988689/" title="Camera Roll-577 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8487988689_f6d557c98f.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-577"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8382189395/" title="Snapseed-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8073/8382189395_73c3692fb0.jpg" alt="Snapseed-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also spotted a woman sporting the latest fashion in sun protection...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383268212/" title="Snapseed-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8383268212_ecd0727183.jpg" alt="Snapseed-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bondi beach is famous worldwide, but I’d had a recommendation to visit a beach slightly further along the coast which was a little less crowded. Regardless, you can easily walk between the two (and lots of other small coves and beaches) along a scenic coastal track to get to where you want to be. The beaches we tried were Bronte and Tamarama. These were certainly quieter than Bondi itself, and were a nice way to spend an afternoon. The water was very rough though, you had to keep your wits about you or you would quickly get dunked by a huge wave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489254788/" title="Sydney-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8112/8489254788_35276e8e53.jpg" alt="Sydney-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489259126/" title="Sydney-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8489259126_67c825a711.jpg" alt="Sydney-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8489264200/" title="Sydney-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8489264200_3a519c5d43.jpg" alt="Sydney-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keen to save money where I could (but only if I thought it wouldn’t detract from the experience), I opted not to do the climb over the Sydney Harbour Bridge, instead paying a fraction of the price to get to the top of one of the pylons. The view from the top of here was still perfectly good, and you have the added benefit of being able to take your camera. On the bridge climb they don’t let you, but are quite happy to take photos for you to purchase at the end of the walk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535713385/" title="Sydney-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8535713385_9f66566916.jpg" alt="Sydney-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8536830406/" title="Sydney-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8536830406_7eb8485eb4.jpg" alt="Sydney-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8535702607/" title="Sydney-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8535702607_261a9939a5.jpg" alt="Sydney-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you will no doubt all understand, a man has to eat. Consequently, there were one or two visits to one or two different restaurants to eat one or two tasty meals. Actually I’ll try and blame Ollie here, as he kept on recommending new places to go... I’m the innocent man here! The very best place we went to, without a shadow of a doubt, was Churrascos. This was a brazilian barbecue place where you have a small disc on the table, green on one side, red on the other. When you turn this to green, the food begins – and it doesn’t stop until you turn it back to red! You pay a fixed price for all you can eat, meaty goodness. As soon as the food is cooked, it is brought round all the tables and offered to you all the while your disc is green. We made sure we went on Wednesday rib night... and it was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just some of the delights on offer are: Rump Cap with Ginger &amp; Soy, Baby Beef with Churrasco BBQ Sauce, Chicken Thigh Fillet in Honey &amp; Soy Sauce, Lamb Rump marinated in Lemon &amp; Oregano, Pork Belly served with Sea Salt &amp; Fresh Lime, Pork Chorizo... I could go on, were it not for the drool that’s now all over my keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8393098213/" title="Camera Roll-680 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8393098213_d9453d080b.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Camera Roll-680"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left a contented man, barely able to waddle to the kerb to hail a taxi to take us home. I’m not going to lie to you, that night was uncomfortable. Maybe I ate too much? .......nah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brief summary of the other places we went to in case you’re ever in Sydney in future: Harry's cafe, very famous and has the photos of hundreds of celebrities having paid a visit to prove it, amazing pie with mushy peas, mash ontop, with a pool of gravy in the middle of the mash! Schnitzel the size of a small planet from Una's! Steak with the most delicious diane sauce from The Botany View, Mad Mex serving heavy, chunky, delicious burritos, smoked salmon and eggs from Newtown cafe, the biggest fried breakfast I’ve ever seen from another cafe in Newtown... I could go on, but I won’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8394202438/" title="Camera Roll-589 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8325/8394202438_92e6bb0581.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Camera Roll-589"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8488132781/" title="Sydney-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8488132781_2ba3f1d810.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Sydney-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time passed quickly, and before we knew it the wonderful day when santa visits had arrived. This was not just any Christmas, this was a Sydney Christmas with Ollie and Luke reunited, and we were going to do it right. I’m pretty sure we succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8394599785/" title="Camera Roll-475 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8507/8394599785_2f344d1122.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8394606323/" title="Camera Roll-477 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8053/8394606323_f3ef524708.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-477"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8379663540/" title="Snapseed-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8472/8379663540_0547496a01.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Snapseed-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was determined to get photos of the new year fireworks in the harbour as I was in Sydney at that time of year. I spent hours planning an almost military style operation in order to find the best spot possible for photos, and then making sure I was there at the best time to mark out my territory and reserve my spot. I was basically there all day, but I’d come prepared with a huge amount of food and drink, so I was well up for the task. I was made up with the photos I managed to take, so I think it was well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383259178/" title="Snapseed-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8355/8383259178_8e13901db7.jpg" alt="Snapseed-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8332159830/" title="NYE-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8078/8332159830_028bfbc604.jpg" alt="NYE-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8330889440/" title="Snapseed-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8358/8330889440_4f696cc8e2.jpg" alt="Snapseed-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8332115906/" title="NYE-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8213/8332115906_bf311754c6.jpg" alt="NYE-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8331067885/" title="NYE-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8215/8331067885_bb4bcd5f74.jpg" alt="NYE-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8332127806/" title="NYE-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8220/8332127806_8a817a2d41.jpg" alt="NYE-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying with Ollie for such a while made me realise what I was missing at home. It’s amazing travelling round on your own but you do start to miss people back home, not to mention the creature comforts you really take for granted without realising! Like, I don’t know... a wardrobe?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude the post, here's just a selection of random photos from my time in Sydney. Way too much going on here to go into detail with all of them, but they pretty much do all the talking anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luetwomey/8383251608/" title="Snapseed-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8496/8383251608_27d3f2ca7b.jpg"     alt="Snapseed-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beautiful sunset in the harbour...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8393072283/" title="Camera Roll-800 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8327/8393072283_d112d42084.jpg"  alt="Camera Roll-800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;So I picked up this chick in Sydney...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8393142895/" title="Camera Roll-551 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8048/8393142895_80e0ee9a21.jpg"  alt="Camera Roll-551"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just being Spiderman, no big deal...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8394589545/" title="Camera Roll-468 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8394589545_90394c31e8.jpg"  alt="Camera Roll-468"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Christmas socks.

Repeat the following day. I guess this was only really topped by my stay at Otres Beach in Cambodia, where I probably could have rolled out of my bed and onto the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One activity that did break this cycle, but still saw me headed to the beach was my time spent surfing! I had been keen to try this along the coast somewhere, and apparently Byron was the place, so I'd waited until I arrived there! Good reviews online saw me head along to Black Dog surf school to book a couple of lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8286921212/" title="_DSC1882x by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8485/8286921212_bfc6407148.jpg" alt="_DSC1882x"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes that's a surfing dog...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was equipped with a top (for some reason all the different schools need to wear a certain colour), and a huge, foam board to learn on. Apparently the larger it is, the easier it is to balance, and the foam meant it wouldn't hurt quite as much IF the board hit me WHEN I wiped out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They began by showing the group exactly how to lie on the board, how to stand up when you're on the wave, how to turn, and the one thing they don't show you which you easily manage to figure out by yourself, is how to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8285882865/" title="P1310511 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8485/8285882865_44f43d3fb8.jpg" alt="P1310511"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Post *splash*...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, for the first lesson the instructors stood out in the water at the point it's best to catch the wave, and then pushed me along on the board as a good one arrived. All my concentration was then focused on actually standing up! The second lesson I was then allowed to try catching my own waves, by paddling when I saw a good one coming in. I soon learnt, to my surprise, this is actually a skill in itself. Often I found myself paddling to catch a wave then feeling it die down to nothing. The instructors are obviously very experienced in picking the best ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few goes at standing up to actually catch the wave, it started to feel a little more natural. I started concentrating less on which foot goes where and what position my body should be in and more on actually balancing on the board! I did still have to keep my feet in check though - if your weight is too far back the board tilts back and the wave goes on without you. Too far forward and you are unceremoniously dumped forward to faceplant the water as the front of the board digs in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just thinking to myself as I rode along the waves "I wish I had someone who could take some photos with my camera right about now" (just for the obligatory proof!), when the next person I saw was from the surf shop, up to her waist in the water, camera in hand, snapping away! God bless these companies and their enterprising ways to squeeze a little more money out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8286926808/" title="P1310211 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8286926808_8949b56a3a.jpg" alt="P1310211"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8286931876/" title="P1310213 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8215/8286931876_ff8eb7d6eb.jpg" alt="P1310213"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8286934342/" title="P1310284 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8286934342_1e9150abd7.jpg" alt="P1310284"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8285880695/" title="P1310510 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8493/8285880695_02ed07b71c.jpg" alt="P1310510"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always happens when you're having fun, the time flew by way too quickly and the lessons were soon over. Overall I reckon I did pretty well. It's tricky at first but definitely not as hard as I expected it to be. I doubt I'll be out on 100 foot waves anytime soon though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8285868787/" title="P1310520 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8498/8285868787_d9d996f1ac.jpg" alt="P1310520"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I lived by the beach and the surf was good enough, I'd definitely buy a board. I often saw locals come down later on in the day around the same sort of time to surf, presumably after knocking off from work. Not a bad way to kill a little time at the start of your evening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in the area also afforded me the opportunity to visit the most easterly point of Australia, Cape Byron and the lighthouse there. It's a short walk from town and a nice tour around the coast to get good views of the rocks and out to sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383211622/" title="Snapseed-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8464/8383211622_91e07c8f8d.jpg" alt="Snapseed-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383216774/" title="Snapseed-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8188/8383216774_c36f291f30.jpg" alt="Snapseed-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383223736/" title="Snapseed-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8190/8383223736_d26b5e4ef1.jpg" alt="Snapseed-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383227620/" title="Snapseed-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8044/8383227620_73b910c029.jpg" alt="Snapseed-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my time in Byron drawing to a close, it also concluded my trip down the east coast before I arrived at my final destination... Sydney!

The place felt very much like student digs, when I arrived there were many bottles, caps and party poppers strewn across the floor from a recent birthday party! There were all super friendly and made me feel really welcome though. They were just putting up their Christmas decorations and had an insane amount of lights and other goodies in the garden for Santa's grotto. It was an epileptic's nightmare, but I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the sofa in the living room, which was really comfortable, at least I thought so. And giving true meaning to the Couchsurfing title! Is it just me that actually really likes sleeping on the sofa? Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was in Brisbane I had my first encounter with a koala bear! I'd not seen one in the wild yet, so I visited Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, a place housing over one hundred and thirty resident bears! I was pretty sure my odds of seeing one there were good. Sure enough, I spotted this fella:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8281968693/" title="Brisbane-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8281968693_c951df208e.jpg" alt="Brisbane-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His name's Barnacle, and he has the taxing job of hugging people all day long. Well, him and his furry friends at least. They work in shifts so they don't get all hugged out. Seriously... They also train them to rotate through different facial expressions throughout the day to mix things up a bit. I got the classic disinterest, but they can also do angry, surprised, happy, what's-that-strange-smell and duckface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8283018274/" title="Brisbane-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8501/8283018274_6b68403da6.jpg" alt="Brisbane-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8281975283/" title="Brisbane-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8281975283_ae76dbd667.jpg" alt="Brisbane-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8281983313/" title="Brisbane-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8216/8281983313_f17084da60.jpg" alt="Brisbane-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not content with koalas, the sanctuary also houses all manner of other animals, from kangaroos to snakes. The kangaroos were flat out lazy, they're so over people touching them. I reckon if they could get away with mauling a kid without getting kicked out of the sanctuary they totally would. The thought of that alone is probably all that gets them through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8282450493/" title="Brisbane-31 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8282450493_c41992b4c8.jpg" alt="Brisbane-31"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8282455353/" title="Brisbane-32 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8282455353_772a0375d5.jpg" alt="Brisbane-32"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8282459087/" title="Brisbane-33 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8361/8282459087_e086436163.jpg" alt="Brisbane-33"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8283144100/" title="Brisbane-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8494/8283144100_01ced880f3.jpg" alt="Brisbane-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8282099257/" title="Brisbane-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8345/8282099257_411f2b5966.jpg" alt="Brisbane-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8283503806/" title="Brisbane-30 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8485/8283503806_5f8a634f3f.jpg" alt="Brisbane-30"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the koalas, my favourite animals were the birds of prey though.

It's very pleasant to walk along here day or night, enjoying the view of the city across the river. You can even go for a swim at the man made lagoon and beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383156344/" title="Snapseed-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8383156344_238393a889.jpg" alt="Snapseed-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8382068617/" title="Snapseed-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8513/8382068617_7204cce59f.jpg" alt="Snapseed-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8382101607/" title="Snapseed-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8382101607_bea6dd3168.jpg" alt="Snapseed-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383181156/" title="Snapseed-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8054/8383181156_97ee374e35.jpg" alt="Snapseed-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383164042/" title="Snapseed-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8332/8383164042_b3d45c776e.jpg" alt="Snapseed-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have the poshest public buses ever. They've decided they're too good to travel on the normal road with the other traffic, and have created ther own private road to drive on. I'm sure London buses look upon their Brisbane brethren with deep envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice walking around at night with the Christmas lights on everywhere, reminded me of home. I also happened upon a rather large Christmas tree in King George Square. You could get some seriously cool presents under that thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8383187016/" title="Snapseed-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8383187016_d99d80c098.jpg" alt="Snapseed-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Christmassy time in Brisbane drew to a close, and I boarded the bus to my next destination, Byron Bay. Christmas surfing!

Axel. Axel makes bass guitars from hand, and it's an impressive sight to say the least. Here's just some of his babies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8390154391/" title="Camera Roll-452 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8390154391_d1a530f1f0.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-452"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand crafting an instrument is a special skill, and it's pretty impressive to see him at work. The attention to detail is incredible and he had multiple instruments on the go while I was there. There's certain stages of the build which require a very specific humidity level in order to make sure the wood doesn't warp or distort. When I arrived it was perfect humidity, and Axel was taking full advantage, working most of the day to get as much done as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hervey Bay is a relatively quiet place, with most of the people gravitating towards the esplanade along the beach. Apparently 90% of the population here are retirees, which would explain the chilled out nature. One of the things I enjoyed was borrowing Axel's bicycle and going for a ride along the esplanade cyclepath, a good 14km. It was a struggle towards the end as I approached hills, I'd not been on a bike in a while! As with a few other places though, the main reason for the visit was not the town itself, but the access it provided to another location - Fraser Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fraser Island draws huge crowds, crowds who fancy a taste of adrenaline filled, 4WD, off road action!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260992080/" title="Fraser Island-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8217/8260992080_e19952c781.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some of you may know, I'm just slightly into my cars. I couldn't pass up a chance to try something as cool as off-roading on an island! You can establish two things from the above photo. 1: One of the cars was pink. 2: You get to drive along the beach. One of these things is massively cooler than the other.... but it is at least some consolation that you dont actually see the pink when you're in the car!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour was run by a hostel in town, and they gave free accomodation for one night either side of the tour. I wouldn't have usually mentioned this, but I wanted to find some way of showing THE BIGGEST KEYRING IN THE WORLD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259459395/" title="Camera Roll-547 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8500/8259459395_08d7842872.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-547"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to Fraser...! What you can't see in the first photo, is Santa. Yep, THE Santa Claus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260479514/" title="Camera Roll-598 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8260479514_563203fa67.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-598"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was our tour guide. This was at the start of December, so in a couple of weeks he was going to put that job on hold and head back to the south pole to check the elves were pulling their fingers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime here he was letting some air out of the tyres in the cars, as it helps when driving on the sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260897214/" title="Fraser Island-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8260897214_577d213348.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were two types of driving tracks on the island, the inland trails, such as this (these were the tame ones!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259446071/" title="Camera Roll-549 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8259446071_657d960e7c.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-549"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259841173/" title="Fraser Island-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8259841173_6fbf32cc6e.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the "highway" (and runway!) along the beach:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260909922/" title="Fraser Island-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8082/8260909922_ff55cec837.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260259863/" title="Fraser Island-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8260259863_8123d3aff9.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When driving along the beach, you'd treat it just like a road, and keep to the left of any other cars coming in the opposite direction. It looks deceptively flat when driving along, but all of a sudden you could come across sections of the beach where water running down from the dunes has channelled out the sand, and you have a massive drop or a big, right angled "kerb" of sand coming straight at you. This would then need a diversion around to try and find a shallower drop, usually further towards the sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day we headed to Lake Wabby. I think that one was possibly just an excuse to get us to walk and get some exercise! To get to the lake was around twenty to thirty minutes walk, but it was well worth it. The lake is right next to a huge sandblow that will eventually completely consume the lake as it's blown further along by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260912900/" title="Fraser Island-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8216/8260912900_cc6ab40e5c.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8261297038/" title="Fraser Island-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8347/8261297038_1f39faa646.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently some retards have tried running at full speed down the sandblow, jumping into the water then breaking their legs or their backs because it's so shallow, then needed airlifting off the island by helicopter. Gives you some indication of what some people here can be like! It was pretty funny watching people trying to lie on a body board and slide down it into the water though. What would inevitably happen is they would run out of momentum, and then stop short about a metre before the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our allotted time at the lake, we headed back to the beach and Santa lead us to our campsite for the night. As there are dingos on the island, this particular campsite was completely fenced off and all the car entrances went over cattle grids, with electrified strips running along! Definitely no danger of dingos in there, then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning we rose early to catch sunrise on the beach, pretty breathtaking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260926788/" title="Fraser Island-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8260926788_b1242d22f5.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still misty at first though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259864437/" title="Fraser Island-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8259864437_7641b681dd.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then headed off to our first stop of the day, Champagne Falls. But not before one of the guys got stuck in the sand. Santa went back to sort them out though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260935106/" title="Fraser Island-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8352/8260935106_b1f8e5e4eb.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260938094/" title="Fraser Island-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8212/8260938094_252d09483a.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259873489/" title="Fraser Island-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8259873489_d6e8763447.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Champagne Falls was a rockpool area by the water, so named due to the similarity of the waves to flowing champagne as the waves roll in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259884621/" title="Fraser Island-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8223/8259884621_a9fecde9ed.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259887275/" title="Fraser Island-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8359/8259887275_151d250606.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259879813/" title="Fraser Island-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8259879813_c69f3ae233.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty cool watching these little things on the rocks, I guess they were some kind of coral... as the waves came crashing in, they would obviously get soaked with water, but then you'd see them squirt it straight back out again in a little jet of water. Apparently they absorb any nutrients they can from the water, then spit out the rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there it was a short drive along the beach to Indian Head, which you can see in the background of this shot:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259882383/" title="Fraser Island-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8502/8259882383_648f6bccb7.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can walk right up to the top, but you're warned against going too close to the edge, with small markers on the ground indicating how far you're allowed to go. Apparently wardens with binoculars monitor this, and if you go too far you're met with a fine after walking back down! Probably rubbish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259918637/" title="Fraser Island-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8353/8259918637_8cb11b7e46.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259921575/" title="Fraser Island-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8492/8259921575_37b4a0e391.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We began our inland adventure after this, heading away from the beach towards the centre of the island. The going became more difficult, as the sand got deeper and the track got steeper and bumpier. At this point I wasn't driving, as we all had to rotate and take turns in the pink car (only Santa was insured to drive the white one). We continued on, arriving at our next stop, Lake Allum. This one was really cool because it was full of tea tree oil, so you could see a film across the water and it looked pretty murky. Apparently it's really good for your skin and your hair. We all went for a swim in the beauty treatment spa pool, with the turtles! Santa got pretty annoyed with some of the lads when they went for a swim to the other side of the lake and back, taking their sweet time about it... oh, Santa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260222663/" title="Fraser Island-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8353/8260222663_0a24a5df8d.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a different route back down to the beach, en route to our next destination, Eli Creek. This one reminded me of the lazy river at Water Palace in Croydon when it was still around (only some of you will know about this one!). This was a great fake river which ran around the edge of the building, where you could just lie back and relax on a rubber ring as the flow of the water pulled you along! The creek was similar, you could walk along a boardwalk to a certain point, before getting in and letting the flow of the water slowly drift you back down to the beach! Amazing... just missing the rubber rings though. This place was really nice at first, when we arrived there was no one there (we'd beaten everybody to each place by getting up so early!). But the crowds soon arrived, and there were soon lots of people there. We took off to our next stop, a campsite on the beach, stopping at the wreck of The Maheno along the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260242583/" title="Fraser Island-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8068/8260242583_036b65a1a7.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8261319554/" title="Fraser Island-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8261319554_9892342d8d.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8261325798/" title="Fraser Island-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8078/8261325798_3594095348.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This steamer had been sold for scrap, and had it's rudder removed to be towed by another boat to Japan. On the way, a storm was encountered which snapped the tow rope, and the ship was washed up onto Fraser where it's remained ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The campsite we went to had no electrified fences this time, we were given strict instructions not to walk anywhere alone as the danger from dingos is very real. They might look like a scrawny little dog, but apparently can be pretty nasty. Not content with the danger from dingos, there are also sharks in the water - so basically you're not safe anywhere! We still went for a swim anyway, up to waist height is fine.... supposedly. I'm still here, at least. This was another place where the view of the stars at night was just incredible, as there was no light pollution anywhere on the island to hamper the visibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day three is where things started to get a little more hairy. Coincidentally, it's when I started driving... funny that! I began driving from the campsite in the morning to the next place, Lake Mackenzie. This was actually no bother, but great fun on the windy little, bumpy inland tracks, sliding about in the sand and having to correct the wheels. Having sat in the other car watching Santa drive, you realise just how many revs you need to be giving the engine to keep the car moving and not get bogged down. Where you would usually change gear on the road, with the engine revving very high, you need to keep it like this in order to make sure you have enough momentum to not get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the morning stint was fine - we made it Lake Mackenzie no bother, which I think was probably my favourite place out of all those we went to. It was very beautiful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260265501/" title="Fraser Island-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8345/8260265501_cc9e378a55.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8261420050/" title="Fraser Island-27 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8261420050_324a6d1029.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-27"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8261426576/" title="Fraser Island-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8261426576_e236453a22.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately things started to go downhill from then on. One of the other lads took over the driving on our way to Lake Barriban. We reached a point where we had to stop due to a traffic jam in front of us. Someone had become stuck in the very dry, soft sand up ahead as they tried to drive up a mild incline. We took a slight side track to get past them and then tried our luck at getting up the hill. We didn't get very far, before we got stuck too. This becomes a very annoying problem, and we were soon to find out, a very painful problem too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody needs to get out of the car, and Santa takes a seat behind the wheel. We then have to push the car from the front, and roll it back down the hill for a while, to get it out of the bog it's buried itself into. Once it's moving freely, and faster than you can push, it's all good and we can get going again. The problem is, cars are bloody heavy. The other problem is, the sand is blisteringly hot. I can honestly say it's the hottest my feet have ever been, and you can't take more than a few brief seconds before you are literally running for the shady patch by the side of the road. It's not helped by the fact you're only wearing flip flops which fall off pushing the car! So after a few attempts, we managed to finally get the car out of the rut it's dug itself into and get it rolling freely. Santa jumps out, gets back into his car and we give it another go. This time the accelerator is firmly planted to the floor, with no mercy! It works, as we rapidly approach the top of the hill with the engine screaming loudly. The car snakes around wildly, from side to side, as eventually we get over the crest of the hill and onto firmer ground. Huge cheers and celebrations are had by all, and we continue on to our last lake before we have to head back to the barge to get back to the mainland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we were there, we had lunch. As we did so, we witnessed a few other cars getting stuck in the sand trying to exit the car park for the lake. There were failed attempts by all to dig the car out, and eventually when another one arrived they resorted to using a tow rope to pull it. Here's Santa lending a hand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260364019/" title="Fraser Island-30 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8260364019_00ef4f248b.jpg" alt="Fraser Island-30"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having witnessed all this first hand, in hindsight it was probably a pretty stupid thing to do to volunteer to drive the final leg back to the barge! We left the car park, and managed to make it past the bit where others had previously got stuck. So far so good. We reached the bottom of the hill we had sped up earlier, and yet again someone had become stuck at exactly the same point as the last person we had driven around. We were forced to stop until they could clear the way, being pulled by another car they were with. With the obstruction gone, we continued... only to get stuck in exactly the same spot that had trapped everybody else. Santa stopped his car, wandered back and looked pretty unhappy, for Santa. We were against the clock, to get to the barge in time. Things were now a little more serious. We got out the car, onto the scorching hot sand and began to dig out the sand in front of each of the wheels. Santa jumped behind the wheel, and we all pushed the car from behind as he floored it. We moved it, for about one metre! This continued for at least five more attempts, and the frustration was increasing... cue plenty of shouting and swearing! The best bit was, Santa had no tow rope in his car. Apparently his boss hadn't packed it. You'd think that was pretty much an essential for amateur off roaders who'd never done it before, but anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time was ticking by, and we were all exhausted. We dug out the wheels one last time, and with one final monumental effort, finally managed to push it far enough for Santa to continue on driving up the road, having safely got out of the bog it was in. We cheered loudly, and rushed back to the car. Unfortunately one of my flip flops was a casualty of war, it fell off during the last big push, and I was physically unable to go back and spend any length of time looking for it due to the heat of the sand. You literally couldn't walk on it, let alone stand digging around for a flip flop, you had to run everywhere! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One flip flop down, I planted my bare foot on the pedal to the floor, and we rushed down the road with no further incident. We made the barge with around twenty minutes to spare, and everybody liked me again! Lucky escape...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/3021884712439824371/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/hervey-bayfraser-island.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3021884712439824371'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3021884712439824371'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/hervey-bayfraser-island.html' title='Hervey Bay/Fraser Island'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2081036228343782577</id><published>2013-01-19T05:39:00.000Z</published><updated>2013-03-06T09:55:20.818Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Bundaberg'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'>Bundaberg</title><content type='html'>Bundaberg didn't really count as a stop, as I was only there for one night, to see one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd read about a beach there where turtles return annually, to lay their eggs on the beach before making their way slowly back down to the water. Months later, the eggs they laid then hatch, and you can witness the baby turtles frantically flapping their way down to the sea. I was there at the right time of year to be able to see the eggs being laid, rather than hatching. I thought it sounded pretty cool so I decided to stop off there briefly to check it out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this is not a popular thing to do - out of a whole Greyhound coachload of people, only myself and one other person got off the bus! I like that though, it makes a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bundaberg also wins the award for shortest walk from the bus to my hostel. I literally stepped off the coach in the bus garage/industrial estate, turned to my right and I was there. Result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular hostel was different to the others I'd been to, in that it catered mainly for backpackers who intended to work on their working holiday visa (mine was just a tourist visa). I checked into my room and met some very friendly Taiwanese girls who had already been there some months, working on a farm picking tomatoes during the day. I made them do this pose:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260731424/" title="Bundaberg-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8363/8260731424_a442f51a33.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They said for every big bucket of tomatoes they pick, they get $5. Not very good money, but still work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 8pm I got a lift from the hostel owner down to the beach, as they were associated with the turtle watching there. As you enter the resort, you're given a group number sticker, then herded around a kind of exhibition, with information about the turtles and the conservation efforts being undertaken by all the wardens at the site. After this, you're moved to a huge outdoor amphitheatre to be welcomed by the head warden and watch a documentary about turtles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, wardens on the beach itself are on turtle patrol, and when they see one coming up the beach to lay, radio back to the head guy. He would then pause the video and call a certain group number to head down to the beach to see the turtle. It's done this way to ensure there are not too many people surrounding the turtle at any one time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were about five groups in total, and I was in group number three. The first two groups got called, and I was willing another turtle to come to the beach for my group to get called!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, after a further ten minutes the call came through, and we were soon trudging down to the beach following a warden. He explained that photography was only allowed at very specific times during the egg laying process, and he would let us know when it was safe to take pics. When we arrived the turtle had picked her spot, and was busily scraping away at the sand with her rear legs, digging a nice deep hole for the eggs. We gathered around behind her, and the warden explained further about what exactly they do when the turtle is on the beach. They will measure them, to gather as much data as possible about that turtle, tag them if they do not already have one and generally check on the condition of the mother to make sure she's healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was as the warden was rambling, that mum decided the hole was now deep enough, and it was time to begin laying the eggs. Everybody craned their necks to try and get a better view, as the warden reached in to place a flashlight at the side of the hole to help us see. It was fascinating watching the ping pong ball style eggs slowly but steadily dropped into the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all the eggs were laid, it was time for mum to go crazy flipping sand behind her in order to cover up the nest. It was also our cue to take photos, as there was now no danger of disturbing here once she was in this "mode".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260725802/" title="Bundaberg-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8360/8260725802_e94766b3fb.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260736248/" title="Bundaberg-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8361/8260736248_14545ffd49.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259671315/" title="Bundaberg-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8354/8259671315_ac48cb04a6.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260741042/" title="Bundaberg-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8501/8260741042_be257b0426.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was as she was doing this, the warden explained we'd have an extra bit of excitement that night, as mum had been lazy and not crawled far enough up the beach to lay her eggs. This meant the nest was too close to the water, and would not have been safe to leave there. When she had finished, and returned to the sea, we would need to dig up the nest, and move the eggs to a different, hand dug nest further up the beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She carried on for what seemed like forever, thrashing about in the sand and hurling it everywhere, until eventually she was satisfied that the nest was well covered. She stopped, gave a huge sigh (I guess) and painstakingly dragged herself back down the beach to the water, a job well done. Well, not really - there was still the matter of having to redo her sloppy job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warden dug down into the nest that he'd marked off before she began covering it, and began pulling the eggs out a few at a time. In total, she'd laid one hundred and forty three eggs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260755566/" title="Bundaberg-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8223/8260755566_71106b2701.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260758234/" title="Bundaberg-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8260758234_ca58ce1d96.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a good job she laid that many, as out of the thousands and thousands of baby turtles that hatch and find their way to the ocean, only one in one thousand actually survive to adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our services were then enlisted to carry the eggs up the beach and hand them back to the warden to place in the new nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260760568/" title="Bundaberg-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8260760568_cc854a82ea.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260762810/" title="Bundaberg-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8260762810_029f982d3f.jpg" alt="Bundaberg-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here they would lay until a few months later, when they would hatch out and begin making their way to the water. All of the babies hatched on this particular beach end up being female - as the temperature of the sand determines the sex. The hotter sand produces females, whereas on other more white sand beaches, where turtles also lay, the cooler temperature produces males.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the show over, I headed back to the hostel to sleep, and set my alarm for the bus the next morning, to Hervey Bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2081036228343782577/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/bundaberg.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2081036228343782577'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2081036228343782577'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/bundaberg.html' title='Bundaberg'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1472598465778089238</id><published>2013-01-18T04:40:00.000Z</published><updated>2013-02-16T20:16:10.248Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Airlie Beach'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Whitsunday Islands'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'>Airlie Beach/Whitsunday Islands</title><content type='html'>I'm buying a boat and no one can stop me! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airlie Beach is packed pull of tourists (as most of the places along the east coast are), shops catering to tourists, and backpacker hostels. It's a fairly lively place, and has plenty of places to get drunk, but really - the draw is the access to the boat tours around the Whitsunday Islands.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259562249/" title="Whitsunday Islands-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8259562249_259dfaf49d.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260679690/" title="Whitsunday Islands-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8260679690_32f82f4833.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260688516/" title="Whitsunday Islands-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8260688516_262051e42b.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260691130/" title="Whitsunday Islands-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8483/8260691130_863c5a7910.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have nice kookaburras though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260707828/" title="Whitsunday Islands-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8260707828_d7a6bd4aeb.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of time online researching which boat to actually book onto. There are a huge number to choose from, and it would really be impossible to decide without seeing what others have had to say about their past experiences on each one. I wanted to avoid a party boat - as I was paying all that money and could easily just go and get pissed on dry land. After much deliberation I settled on one and phoned the agent to book my place. They were already fully booked! The agent told me about all the other boats they had available instead, so I went back to the drawing board and looked into those ones. They really didn't look as good, and I was pretty disappointed I couldn't get on the one I wanted initially! I phoned back and asked her if she had any space on the next trip for that boat, leaving a couple of days later. She did! I booked it. It would mean hanging around slightly longer than I'd intended to, but I decided it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a few days later, I showed up at the marina and met her for the first time, Silent Night:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260716172/" title="Whitsunday Islands-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8260716172_fc6cd6beab.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260889184/" title="Whitsunday Islands-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8084/8260889184_1931334630.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a mini maxi, holding up to twelve people. Some of the bigger party catamarans can hold around one hundred... 'nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hopped on board, and met our skipper Sammy and deckhand Taylor. They took us through the do's and don'ts for the boat, the big one being don't go on the suicide side of the boat (nearest the water) when you're leaning over at a ridiculous angle sailing along, as you'll probably fall in. And that's bad. Oh, wait - sorry I forgot the number one rule of the boat was actually "stay sexy at all times". An important requirement when sailing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we left the harbour, we put the sail up for the first time. I helped with one other guy to pull the rope down through the mast, which hoists the sail up to the top. It gets harder the further up it goes, as there's more weight you need to pull. Good fun though, and the most exercise I'd had in a few weeks! With the sails up, the boat began to lean over heavily. It's such a strange feeling at first but you soon get used to walking around at an angle after a while. It's very odd being down below and looking out, as everything is all wonky compared to the horizon, The cooker swings on hinges though, to keep anything cooking on there level, which I thought was pretty clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259652877/" title="Whitsunday Islands-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8487/8259652877_257f5ef6da.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some time, the wind died down substantially and we took the sails down, switching instead to running the engine to keep us moving. That was actually the only time on the trip we went that far sideways, as although we put the sail up plenty of other times, the wind was blowing at a different angle, which meant we kept level but sailed at the same speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived at a small cove a little while later, where we were to go for our first snorkel of the trip. This was just a little "warm up" as it wasn't the best location, but was convenient to get to and and on the way to where we needed to moor up for the night. We were handed our snorkels and taken off the back of the boat closer to shore, on the small dinghy we had been trailing along behind us. Jumping off the side of the boat backwards (navy style!), we spent some time in the water before getting called back to the boat. IT wasn't the best place, as expected - but we still saw a good few fish while we were there. We were promised better visibility at the other places we would stop at over the next couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continued on to Hooke Passage, where we dropped anchor and came to rest at our stop for the night. There were a few other boats around us, as this was the best place to hold tight for the night, in smooth waters sheltered from the rough waves. We watched the sunset from here and it was such a chilled out moment, it was so nice. Sitting there with a beer in your hand, bobbing very gently on the water and enjoying the view, it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259552081/" title="Airlie Beach-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8259552081_159a36fb12.jpg" alt="Airlie Beach-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260693222/" title="Whitsunday Islands-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8356/8260693222_51423761aa.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't quite so amazing when we went to bed that night though, it was then I discovered I had the world's loudest snorer in the bunk below me! Ah well, you win some you lose some. It still didn't stop me from sleeping! The whole boat burst out laughing when he let out the loudest fart in the world though, it literally rocked the boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waking up nice and early the next morning, we rose anchor and began sailing to Whitehaven Beach. This beach is something like number two in the list of best beaches in the world, and I can really see why. We did ask Sammy what number one was, but his only reply was "it doesn't matter". When we got there, we saw why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260781722/" title="Whitsunday Islands-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8204/8260781722_e3eb7b6a78.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259717297/" title="Whitsunday Islands-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8081/8259717297_2af6238edc.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259736987/" title="Whitsunday Islands-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8259736987_d562635b8b.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260806450/" title="Whitsunday Islands-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8059/8260806450_bdb2e3d7fb.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260809972/" title="Whitsunday Islands-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8260809972_a014f6ccc6.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beach is something like 98% pure silica, which is why the sand is so white, and also how it stays so cool. Unlike most beaches that become a nightmare to walk on in the midday sun, this was perfect as it remained cool no matter how hot it became. We sunbathed here for a while, with stingrays in the water only a metre or two away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260796618/" title="Whitsunday Islands-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8083/8260796618_eb5ecf9371.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When our time was up, we reluctantly made our way back to the boat, to continue our journey around the islands. Before we left we managed to catch sight of a few green turtles though, as they surfaced for air. Much like all the other marine life I've tried to photograph along the way (dolphins in Cambodia, crocodiles in Darwin), these things were a nightmare to get a photo of, but luckily a couple came up and stuck around long enough to get a few decent shots:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260874872/" title="Whitsunday Islands-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8219/8260874872_3301db8e3f.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260812024/" title="Whitsunday Islands-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8260812024_6492e5e6c7.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continued our voyage, with me at the helm:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259754391/" title="Whitsunday Islands-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8477/8259754391_a328f6f430.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK not really, if you look closely you can see the wheel was still tied - we were still anchored at this point! We got underway with the real skipper at the wheel, and sailed off to our next snorkelling spot. The best one so far, easily! This reef was home to a giant maori wrase (pic stolen from google):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8388874666/" title="Camera Roll-725 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8091/8388874666_fd67084140.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-725"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could literally run your hand along the body of this fish as it was swimming along, take a deep breath, dive down and swim along with it and it wouldn't care in the slightest. It was by far the best snorkelling experience I've had. It's remarkable being in the water at the same time as something that big - even though it probably pales into insignificance compared to some beasts! It was also a manic experience when the deckhands would throw chunks of bread into the water at you from the dinghys, and you would instantly be surrounded by hundreds of smaller fish all wanting a piece of the action. Quite incredible, and so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After emerging from the water, we continued on to our next anchorage for the night. Another beautiful sunset, then a nice (nearly) full moon illuminating the boat at night:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260815702/" title="Whitsunday Islands-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8359/8260815702_1665dec64d.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rising the next morning, we moved a short way away from where we'd stopped to the last reef of the trip. Unfortunately, the visibility here wasn't so good, so we didn't spend quite so long in the water as the previous day. We clambered back on board and began our journey back home to Airlie Beach, on the way putting up the spinnaker sail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260843224/" title="Whitsunday Islands-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8495/8260843224_50d5f796c7.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259814173/" title="Whitsunday Islands-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8259814173_a511482c03.jpg" alt="Whitsunday Islands-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sail is a huge, unruly beast and Sammy was in two minds about whether or not to actually put it up, as it can be quite dangerous if not handled correctly and it somehow gets caught up or ends up in the water. That's why when it came to putting it back down, all our help was enlisted as we sat at the front side of the boat in a row, ready to pull in the sail onto our laps as it was lowered. All went without a hitch, and we safely made it back to the harbour on engine power, as by then the wind had died down completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the best things I've done so far, and yes... I now need a boat. I probably should learn how to sail first, but a boat is definitely in my future. And a nice top floor apartment, with a balcony overlooking the marina where my beautiful boat is moored up. That's the dream! One day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1472598465778089238/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/airlie-beachwhitsunday-islands.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1472598465778089238'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1472598465778089238'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/airlie-beachwhitsunday-islands.html' title='Airlie Beach/Whitsunday Islands'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2332236974928103996</id><published>2013-01-17T02:03:00.001Z</published><updated>2013-02-12T05:50:45.010Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cairns'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'>Cairns</title><content type='html'>Hi, my name's Luke, and I'm a nudeaholic. I stayed with another male nudist. I'll let you start wondering about my sexual orientation while I continue with the the blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands up if you've heard of The Great Barrier Reef! *raises hand eagerly* ... Cairns is one of the places you can visit the reef, and having dived in Thailand previously to get a taster of marine life, I was really looking forward to it. The fact I'd dived already on my trip also gave me a conundrum though - I wasn't sure whether to pay a bit more money at the reef and go scuba diving, or save and just snorkel instead. In the end I went with snorkelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vessel was a modern, stylish catamaran, with full access at the back to get down to the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235721381/" title="Cairns-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8235721381_cc13976eea.jpg" alt="Cairns-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235920327/" title="Cairns-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8235920327_453ab00c60.jpg" alt="Cairns-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat did provide the option of diving if you wanted to, once at the reef, but it really wasn't worth it at the places we went to. The first dive site was at Paradise Reef - full of beautifully patterned, vibrantly coloured fish. It was best to swim just at the edge of the reef, as it dropped off steeply into the depths below, as there lay the greatest variety of marine life. But as I was swimming along here, I could see the scuba divers not far below. They couldn't have been more than ten metres down, and I could see everything they could from the surface anyway. The great thing about snorkelling is it's also far less cumbersome than the scuba equipment you need to use when diving. Great for quickly jumping off the back of the boat and getting maximum time in the water with Nemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had debated whether or not to hire an underwater camera for this trip, but as I'd already got plenty of underwater shots from my scuba diving in Thailand, I decided against it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paradise Reef was a fantastic location, I believe mainly due to the fact our tour company "Passions of Paradise" was the only operator allowed to visit that particular reef. This helps ensure marine life remains healthy and as undisturbed as possible. It certainly appeared to be thriving, the coral was very colourful and seemed in good condition. The fish were everywhere, and very diverse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our first snorkel, we sailed on to our next site at Michaelmas Cay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8237914264/" title="Cairns-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8237914264_5a0d7d0692.jpg" alt="Cairns-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8239304395/" title="Cairns-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8239304395_ab8e44abe4.jpg" alt="Cairns-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8240385722/" title="Cairns-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8240385722_04738055d9.jpg" alt="Cairns-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beach was a birdlife reserve, but obviously the most interesting stuff was underneath the water. Clownfish, angelfish, stingrays,  maori wrase, butterflyfish, sharks. There was a great variety. Also immediately surrounding the boat were huge numbers of giant trevally, an extremely quick fish that are an apex predator in those waters. The crew of the boat would throw food overboard to the fish, and they're actually clever enough (and quick enough) to see the food in mid-air, and swim to where it will land before it's even hit the water, an amazing sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8240464044/" title="Cairns-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8240464044_4bb918cb08.jpg" alt="Cairns-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8240478998/" title="Cairns-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8240478998_dc9a92f049.jpg" alt="Cairns-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel time to and from the reef was a good chance for sunbathing, and most took full advantage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8239354553/" title="Cairns-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8490/8239354553_a0fd7552ee.jpg" alt="Cairns-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8240494140/" title="Cairns-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8240494140_e76401692e.jpg" alt="Cairns-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8237011642/" title="Cairns-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8237011642_be3e1a15ae.jpg" alt="Cairns-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on dry land I made my way back to Frank's. Frank was a Couchsurfing host who had very kindly answered an emergency couch request I placed on the website. The hostel I had been staying in was one of the worst I've encountered. There were no useful staff members in the whole place, instead being run by backpackers themselves in return for free board. I was lying in bed one day, when a lost looking Japanese girl wandered into the dorm and asked if there were any beds free. I had no idea, but pointed out the ones immediately surrounding me were already in use. The girl strolled off, presumably to find a useless staff member, and I went out for a while, thinking no more of it. When I returned a short time later, I found all my things had been dumped off my bunk onto the one above me, including my bedding, and the girl had taken up refuge there. Brilliant. Thanks for that. I'm sure you're not likely to anyway, but don't ever stay at Reef Backpackers in Cairns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having received Frank's invitation, I jumped at the chance. There was a slight catch, however... Frank's home is a nudist one. And it's even more nudey than Stephen and Kevin's place in Darwin, as being nude is more of a rule/lifestyle rather than an occasional thing. To the extent that clothes would need to be removed on the secluded patio before even entering the house. Frank was also hosting other surfers at the time as he had a few spare beds. Four naked men sitting down round a table to dinner is something I doubt I'll ever experience again. The funny thing is, it actually felt less weird eating dinner in that situation than it had on the nights I'd spent in the hostel. They gave out daily food vouchers for a huge backpackers down the road, letting you pick up a free "meal" each night. This resulted in a huge queue of people lining up to get their free dinner. It almost felt like a homeless shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank is a really cool guy, he's hosted hundreds of backpackers already so is well experienced and fantastic for helping out with seeing things in the area. To the extent that he hired a car for us all - splitting the cost between us - and drove us up to Port Douglas and Mossman Gorge on a day out. Above and beyond the call of duty! And a great example of the kindness of hosts you'll experience on the Couchsurfing website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8236797070/" title="Cairns-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8236797070_9473f8ea00.jpg" alt="Cairns-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8236804494/" title="Cairns-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8203/8236804494_4d711df97f.jpg" alt="Cairns-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235835547/" title="Cairns-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8068/8235835547_ab02271a0b.jpg" alt="Cairns-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235841635/" title="Cairns-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8066/8235841635_c7899f4322.jpg" alt="Cairns-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235850545/" title="Cairns-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8066/8235850545_542ba6cc0f.jpg" alt="Cairns-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235887911/" title="Cairns-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8235887911_edbbd609c4.jpg" alt="Cairns-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mossman Gorge was good fun, if very busy. You were able to get down to the water and go for a swim, and play around near the cascading water flowing down over the rocks from further upstream. It was a very picturesque place and a really nice spot to spend some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up was Airlie Beach. And I promised myself I'd avoid getting naked at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2332236974928103996/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/cairns.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2332236974928103996'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2332236974928103996'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/cairns.html' title='Cairns'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2824165850343415206</id><published>2013-01-15T04:58:00.001Z</published><updated>2013-01-18T04:46:34.085Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Alice Springs'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'>Alice Springs</title><content type='html'>One thing on the agenda here - Ayers Rock, otherwise known as Uluru. It would have been almost criminal for me to visit Australia and not go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My options again were limited - I ended up booking a three day tour including Uluru (Ayers Rock), Kings Canyon and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas). Far more convenient than trying to arrange things yourself, and the added benefit of a group to go with to make it a bit more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Here's something for ya, the first of our two right hand turns for the day. The other one is 200km's down the road. If you want to go to Kings Canyon it's a little more complicated. That's three right turns...". Our tour guide fancied himself as a comedian. In fairness, he was actually quite amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the drive out we were treated to some information about snakes. Apparently, around 90% of the venomous snakebites in Australia are "dry bites". This is where the snake doesn't actually inject any venom. The reason for this is because it is defending itself, and warning you away - if it were to inject venom it would be left defenceless and have no other means of protecting itself. If we were to encounter any snakes during our tour, it would likely be the inland taipan or the king brown - in number one and two spots on the twenty deadliest snakes in the world. One drop of venom can kill twelve people. Reassuring. When they're looking straight at you, they're aiming for a strike and you really should be in another place. Swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got lucky with the temperature, the week before I'd arrived it was in the 40's - I literally would not have been able to move. While I was there it was in the mid 20's, which was nice and comfortable. We stopped at a lookout on the way to Uluru, across to Mount Connor (shaped like a toothbrush!). At first glance when you see a big rock on the horizon from the window of the bus, you think it's Uluru. It's not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first stop was straight to the rock (the real one, not the imposter!). We got off the coach and were told of the importance of only taking photographs in the designated areas. Certain parts of Uluru are seen as extremely sacred areas, and the aboriginal people do not allow photos to be taken at those points. The rock has an 11km walk around its base - which we eagerly began. The guide didn't - he obviously had more important things to do, like sitting in the coach. It was quite a spectacle to look across and see such a huge object in front of you, at first... if I'm honest it gets a bit "samey" after a while. For the whole 11km you pretty much have the same view, and while it's an impressive sight, you don't get a sense of the enormity of it all - as you do when viewing it from a distance. Learning from my experience in Darwin with the most annoying flies in the world, I'd bought a baseball cap and fly net to keep the buggers at bay. It worked brilliantly, and the best bit was it was highly fashionable and made me look cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8382550522/" title="Camera Roll-232 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8382550522_ca482f807f.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234735635/" title="Alice Springs-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8487/8234735635_b033b826b3.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234752815/" title="Alice Springs-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8234752815_0272a96aa3.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234768847/" title="Alice Springs-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8234768847_11b1c90052.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have the option of climbing the rock at one point - at least you normally do, it was closed on the day we went due to high winds. The aboriginal people politely request you do not climb - due to the sacred nature of the site. But if you are so inclined, you are allowed to do so. Regardless, we didn't need to make that decision as it was already made for us that particular day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After completing the base walk, and returning to the coach, we headed off to join the masses (and I do mean masses!) of people gathering at the best vantage point for viewing Uluru at sunset. The number of people here was just staggering - and apparently it's like that 365 days a year, without fail. Crazy, you might think initially - but as the sun begins to set you really do understand why. The view is quite incredible, with Uluru displaying beautiful red colouring from the warm light of the sun. And what better way to enjoy it than with champagne, crackers and dips?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234827877/" title="Alice Springs-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8234827877_47510e1c74.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234834703/" title="Alice Springs-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8479/8234834703_239c518b33.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sun had set, and the crowds of people had abated, we made our way to our campsite for the night. Pulling up to an open stretch of grass with a shelter next to it to eat, we unpacked our swags and settled down for the evening. For those who have no idea what a swag is (like me when I first heard about them!), it's basically a really posh sleeping bag. The outside of it is waterproof - and has a flap that covers your head at night if it does decide to rain - ensuring you stay dry. Inside there's a thin foam mattress with a pillow, all inside the traditional sleeping bag padding. It was so comfortable you wouldn't believe it. All swagged up, we lay beneath the stars on a beautifully clear night. This was seriously one of my favourite bits of the tour - it's only looking up at the stars and actually taking the time to appreciate them that you realise just how tiny everything really is. I saw some shooting stars as well which was amazing, and I lay there for a long time in awe before finally drifting off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning we rose before the sun, to make our way to a different viewpoint in order to catch the sunrise over Uluru. Our campsite location and early start meant we got to the site before everybody else, and were in front row seats for the view. Unfortunately, I'd failed slightly with my camera - I'd forgotten to charge my spare battery, and the one in the camera was virtually dead. This meant I wasn't my usual shutter-happy self, but luckily I still managed to get a few pics I was happy with. By being very selective with the photos I took with my camera, I managed to make it last for most of the rest of the tour, using my iPhone as a substitute in the meantime. The viewpoint we had gone to also gave great views over Kata Tjuta - double bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235946408/" title="Alice Springs-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8207/8235946408_7be7357ee3.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235970726/" title="Alice Springs-36 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8345/8235970726_31b7e9c892.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-36"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, Kata Tjuta was our next destination - where a windy walk awaited us in The Valley Of The Winds. It lived up to its billing, with high winds channelled through the valley towards us. Apparently, they also filmed scenes from Priscilla Queen of The Desert here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235589528/" title="Alice Springs-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8235589528_c4bd86d5a4.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234533425/" title="Alice Springs-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8203/8234533425_97abc43075.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235612830/" title="Alice Springs-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8198/8235612830_d5feeb1303.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the high winds of the valley behind, we made our way to our next campsite, stopping along the way to gather firewood. It's while you're doing this you become acutely aware of the possibility of being bitten by a camouflaged snake. Good fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the menu that night was kangaroo steak and camel burger. Both were delicious! Kangaroo is very gamey, and camel basically tastes like beef. Eat them. I still need to try crocodile and emu...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our final day was spent at Kings Canyon. You had a choice of two different walks here, one in the canyon itself where you were more likely to see wildlife, or a longer one climbing to the canyon ridge for the views. The majority went with the latter option, and we soon found ourself gazing spellbound across the outback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234932837/" title="Alice Springs-38 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8234932837_76a8578e37.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-38"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234948953/" title="Alice Springs-39 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8487/8234948953_b29b793947.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-39"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite bit was arriving at a point where it was safe to get down on your stomach, and wriggle to the edge of the rock to poke your head over the side, peering down into the canyon below. Quite a feeling, and certainly not one to try if you're not fond of heights, or falling from them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234962989/" title="Alice Springs-40 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8234962989_6979b97c07.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also a point where you could straddle a huge crack in the rock, where literally the whole of the side of the canyon is gradually coming away. If you throw a rock down the gap you can hear it fall for a long way down deep into the rock. At some point the whole lot will eventually give way and slide off the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fun continued, as we made our way in the coach to a station where they keep camels, dingos and so on. For a small fee, you were able to ride one of the camels for a few minutes around a small compound on the farm. The one I ended up on was extremely grumpy, and did nothing but moan from the first person to ride him. We were walked down to one end of the pen, before being bumped around mercilessly on the way back as the camels ran to keep up with their handler. Good fun, but probably not a pet I'd consider getting anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234670947/" title="Alice Springs-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8234670947_21109a7876.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234677583/" title="Alice Springs-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8234677583_e8228b772f.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234684935/" title="Alice Springs-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8234684935_e69e420d56.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Springs itself is unremarkable, and really the only good reason for going there is to visit the attractions surrounding it. I also visited Ellery Creek and Standley Chasm while I was there. Ellery Creek was very cool, a beautiful spot to swim, in a secluded cove with a beach, surrounded by rocks and trees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8235044919/" title="Alice Springs-45 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8235044919_3fa1e76fc1.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-45"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standley Chasm was also nice. Until I broke my camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8236240790/" title="Alice Springs-52 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8236240790_28ca8cbf09.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-52"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8236220028/" title="Alice Springs-51 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8236220028_dbf3f82387.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-51"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8236267604/" title="Alice Springs-53 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8236267604_7989111b7b.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-53"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8236351782/" title="Alice Springs-58 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8236351782_d6ab5f8358.jpg" alt="Alice Springs-58"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd set it up on my mini tripod, on a rock. It was just about to take the photo when a gust of wind must have caught it and slowly tipped it over. It literally happened in slow motion. The annoying thing is, it toppled over so slowly I probably could have run to catch it, but I didn't bother as I thought it would move a lot faster than it did. The best bit was, it fell in a pool of water which had collected at the side of the chasm. I quickly pulled it out, took the battery and memory card out, and stuck it in a bag of rice to dry out when I got back. A few days later I tried to turn it on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8259539687/" title="Camera Roll-425 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8259539687_476fe28ee3.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-425"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aw crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2824165850343415206/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/alice-springs.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2824165850343415206'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2824165850343415206'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/alice-springs.html' title='Alice Springs'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-6504627496595480302</id><published>2013-01-14T05:16:00.001Z</published><updated>2013-01-14T05:16:24.686Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Darwin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'>Darwin</title><content type='html'>Just your average accommodation here… I stayed with a gay, nudist couple. More on that later - I'll build some suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darwin was my stop off point for the Kakadu National Park. When I first bought my round-the-world plane ticket I had to tell them which places I wanted to visit in Australia, so they could include those flights in the overall price. I picked some cool "attractions" around the country and went with the nearest cities. Seemed like a good way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kakadu is actually a lot further from Darwin than you realise. Australia is quite big. Very big in fact - around sixty times bigger than the UK. Gone were the days of just showing up somewhere and easily being able to see the sights - I was forced to book onto a tour. I found one which visited both Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks, camping out in the bush overnight - perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at the tour agent early in the morning, in preparation for a long day of awesomeness, we were rounded up by our tour guide Luke (I could tell immediately he was a great guy) and began our drive to the park. Along the way he handed round a microphone to everyone in the minibus so we could introduce ourselves and tell the group a little of what we were about - a nice way to break the ice. There were of course obligatory Germans - seriously, they're everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first stop saw us driving down our first red dirt road of the trip - very exciting! We were headed for the Mary River, where we would board a boat to take us on a little blast upriver and down, in search of crocodiles and other wildlife. Unfortunately all the crocodiles had decided that particular day was too hot for them, and had made their way into the water rather than basking in the sun on the riverbanks. This meant that while we did see them, it was no more than a fleeting glimpse as they briefly surfaced to check us out before submerging again a few seconds later. This made photos nearly impossible, but there was still plenty of twitching to be done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232111302/" title="Darwin-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8345/8232111302_523e53c514.jpg" alt="Darwin-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8231057387/" title="Darwin-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8231057387_066133391d.jpg" alt="Darwin-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8231201111/" title="Darwin-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8231201111_e5cb0945cf.jpg" alt="Darwin-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232288448/" title="Darwin-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8232288448_c611018781.jpg" alt="Darwin-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We disembarked from the boat, and headed away from the crocodile infested waters towards our next destination, Ubirr. This place is famous for its aboriginal rock art, and evidentally - phenomenal views across the outback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8184276369/" title="Darwin-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8184276369_6aaae62af8.jpg" alt="Darwin-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232335686/" title="Darwin-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8232335686_312b28b7c1.jpg" alt="Darwin-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8231284457/" title="Darwin-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8487/8231284457_0aa99abb0f.jpg" alt="Darwin-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232387690/" title="Darwin-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8232387690_48601fc399.jpg" alt="Darwin-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232403466/" title="Darwin-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8232403466_e38feaace1.jpg" alt="Darwin-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8231348371/" title="Darwin-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8231348371_f887f75fc1.jpg" alt="Darwin-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8231332561/" title="Darwin-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8231332561_323949ded6.jpg" alt="Darwin-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at just how green everything was, but that's the result of heavy rainfall which brings everything to life. The foliage was certainly flourishing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our campsite for the night was a permanent site with pretty big tents - more like little huts, surrounding a large marquee where we ate our meals. The site also had a swimming pool. You can probably guess how the rest of the afternoon was spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rose at 6am the next morning - some of us feeling slightly worse for wear after a few drinks the night before. After packing up all our junk into our trusty minibus and trailer, we continued our journey to our next port of call - Gunlom Falls. This was a fantastic place with a waterfall flowing down into a plunge pool at the bottom of a rockface, but the best bit was rewarded by a fairly steep ascent - to the source of the waterfall up above. Here lies a series of pools of water, all flowing into one last "infinity" pool before finally plunging over the edge of the cliff face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234105702/" title="Darwin-33 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8234105702_26692f8af0.jpg" alt="Darwin-33"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8233000871/" title="Darwin-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8483/8233000871_43f41b57e4.jpg" alt="Darwin-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8233011865/" title="Darwin-30 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8233011865_20c833b38e.jpg" alt="Darwin-30"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232971593/" title="Darwin-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8232971593_705975b4cb.jpg" alt="Darwin-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8232993239/" title="Darwin-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8232993239_bec152ae28.jpg" alt="Darwin-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You were given strict instructions not to get too close to the edge, as people can - and have in the past - slipped and fallen to their deaths below. Not a nice thought, and one prominently in your mind as you're walking from rock to rock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a whole morning spent here, swimming and messing around, everyone was pretty tired:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8379298098/" title="Darwin stbu-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8379298098_44810a9516.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had the opportunity to sleep for a good while though, as we had a long drive to the edge of Kakadu, to another campsite where we could be up the following morning in good time to beat the rest of the crowds to all the best spots in Litchfield. This time we were sleeping in "proper" tents - although it was so hot you really didn't need the cover at all - we put the bug nets up and left it at that. They really were needed as well - the flies in this area are the most annoying flies you've ever encountered. They are constantly there and will not leave your face alone for more than a few seconds. You are endlessly swatting them away and it really becomes quite irritating after a while! There was one girl who had experienced this before and bought a fly net and hat - I was seriously contemplating stealing this from her during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8233080771/" title="Darwin-37 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8233080771_c6d014c7a4.jpg" alt="Darwin-37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234295652/" title="Darwin-41 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8234295652_eba075f4f7.jpg" alt="Darwin-41"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234205050/" title="Darwin-40 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8486/8234205050_b9306bfa6e.jpg" alt="Darwin-40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234432817/" title="Darwin-39 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8234432817_4041f9ecdd.jpg" alt="Darwin-39"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This site also had a pool. You can probably guess how the rest of the afternoon was spent once again... But this time we spent a good 15 minutes trying to get a timed shot of us (a group of about fifteen people!) all jumping into the water at the same time. We didn't really manage it - apart from a few blurry ones, but good fun nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8378219413/" title="Darwin stbu-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8378219413_95fbb7a709.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also a guy called Richard who was well into his photography and managed to get some very cool light painting photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8379298528/" title="Darwin stbu-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8379298528_43d188c1e3.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8379334846/" title="Darwin stbu-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8045/8379334846_2993bd2f04.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning we had an early start yet again to venture into Litchfield National Park for the first time. Our long drive the day before and our early headstart meant we were able to miss most of the crowds at the best places. As you can imagine, there are a large number of tour companies which operate in the area herding people around from point to point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed to Florence Falls, a twin waterfall which you could go and swim under. Very cool. Very Peter Andre. Unfortunately one of the lads managed to dislocate his finger as he jumped into the water - apparently catching it on something. Luckily for him, one of the group was a doctor so she was able to reset it and all was well! It hurt, obviously - but it didn't seem to faze him too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234258034/" title="Darwin-51 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8234258034_28eb525b3b.jpg" alt="Darwin-51"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234262558/" title="Darwin-53 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8063/8234262558_2abfa5b200.jpg" alt="Darwin-53"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pool was really relaxing to swim in. It's a good thing we weren't there in wet season though, things would have been slightly more hectic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8378470091/" title="Camera Roll-750 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8378470091_94335b96b6.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-750"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped off at a bunch of termite mounds after our swim - you don't realise how huge these things are until you get up close to them. They're apparently made from spit and shit, which is nice. This forms to be pretty rock solid - and is meant as a defence from ants, who are constantly trying to attack the termites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234223068/" title="Darwin-43 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8234223068_59afdc1e27.jpg" alt="Darwin-43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8233165811/" title="Darwin-44 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8233165811_edc09c4e2c.jpg" alt="Darwin-44"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8234241590/" title="Darwin-47 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8234241590_d7223ae4d6.jpg" alt="Darwin-47"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last waterfall stop on this tour was to Wangi Falls. Much the same as the others, you could swim right under the falls which is a really cool feeling (literally, in this case - as the water was ice cold, a refreshing change). After more fun and games here, we were all pretty tired - but managed to summon our energy reserves for one last stop off before returning back to Darwin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's good that we stayed awake for this one, as it was probably my joint favourite spot along with Gunlom Falls and the infinity pool. Buley Rockhole was a series of pools which flowed down into each other, that you could literally slide through on your belly with a little care. Some bits were also deep enough for more silly jumping:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8239546161/" title="Darwin stbu-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr target="_blank""&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8239546161_e6fc6eb98c.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8240587762/" title="Darwin stbu-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8240587762_1445bb0a88.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8378236181/" title="Darwin stbu-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8378236181_9d0352f625.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8261588386/" title="Camera Roll-449 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8077/8261588386_79aebd3dc5.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-449"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8260510813/" title="Camera Roll-447 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8483/8260510813_9f72c6cf90.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-447"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great place to go to just before we headed back, and ended the tour on a definite high note. No one dislocated or broke any bones there either, which was handy. We did also briefly stop at a rest stop to grab some snacks - the owner then got the baby python out for us to play with which was pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8239763743/" title="Darwin stbu-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8477/8239763743_6edc49116b.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving back in Darwin, I headed back to the nudist den. You may remember I'd been couchsurfing way back at the start of my trip, in Hong Kong. I found Stephen and Kevin through the same website. They have a swimming pool in their back garden, and had eventually got tired of changing in and out of swimshorts whenever they use their pool. Makes sense - and if you're in your own home, why not? They weren't naked all of the time, just, some of the time. All this was clear and upfront on their profile, and I didn't really care - so that's how I ended up there staying with them for a little while. They're really nice guys, and after a short while it's not really weird anymore. And yes, I ended up partaking. Just in the pool though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8239674543/" title="Darwin stbu-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8239674543_fc00b7b465.jpg" alt="Darwin stbu-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/6504627496595480302/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/darwin.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/6504627496595480302'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/6504627496595480302'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2013/01/darwin.html' title='Darwin'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7530246425804562381</id><published>2012-11-14T07:51:00.001Z</published><updated>2012-11-14T07:51:29.714Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Singapore'/><title type='text'>Singapore</title><content type='html'>Possibly one of the nicest places I've been to so far. Everything is clean and modern, and the transport system makes it very easy to get around. It is more expensive than other southeast Asian countries, but it's easy to see why. It's a very pleasant place to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again I was staying in Chinatown, at Matchbox The Concept Hostel. This place was really funky. Slightly more expensive than I would usually have paid but worth it just for the experience. The dorm beds aren't your typical bunk beds, you sleep in a self contained pod, with your own light and power points. The common area was well designed, with a huge television, DVD collection, bean bag chairs, foot massager and swings (not shown in this photo I stole!). A very unique experience and definitely recommended if you ever visit the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8184269531/" title="Camera Roll-559 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8184269531_c59a846d86.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-559"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8184307110/" title="Camera Roll-558 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8184307110_709bb12e70.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-558"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8184307582/" title="Camera Roll-560 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8184307582_b841f478a5.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-560"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the areas I was most familiar with, having watched the Formula 1 races there in recent years, was the marina. Dominated by the Marina Bay Sands resort, this area was very impressive by day or night, attracting huge numbers of people. As if the backdrop wasn't impressive enough, there was a nightly lightshow, with video projected onto a wall of misty water. Very clever, and drew a huge crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099461538/" title="Singapore-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8099461538_d2700b0842.jpg" alt="Singapore-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099457016/" title="Singapore-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8099457016_5eae4b2634.jpg" alt="Singapore-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099460386/" title="Singapore-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8185/8099460386_f9df8eb7cf.jpg" alt="Singapore-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099456789/" title="Singapore-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8184/8099456789_25b3ede8bc.jpg" alt="Singapore-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099460537/" title="Singapore-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8470/8099460537_82f1aaa229.jpg" alt="Singapore-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099462913/" title="Singapore-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8054/8099462913_01e8b0fce0.jpg" alt="Singapore-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099473060/" title="Singapore-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8476/8099473060_eb7a9c83b5.jpg" alt="Singapore-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099474542/" title="Singapore-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8052/8099474542_874e034e39.jpg" alt="Singapore-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099476084/" title="Singapore-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8195/8099476084_1601c7b1a1.jpg" alt="Singapore-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099477450/" title="Singapore-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8099477450_557889619a.jpg" alt="Singapore-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8099473967/" title="Singapore-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8474/8099473967_591522d16f.jpg" alt="Singapore-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Singapore zoo came very highly rated, so it was a must see for me while I was there. Unfortunately, the weather took a turn for the worse in the middle of my visit, with very heavy rain and thunder and lightning. But after an hour or two, this soon passed by and I was able to see the rest of the animals. I've really been very lucky with rain, it has in fact not been the "ideal" time of year to visit a lot of the places I've been to, but even in rainy season it's not stopped me from being able to do what I wanted to do in each place. If the rain does come, it usually only hangs around for an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zoo was home to a pair of white tigers, which I have to say were probably my favourite animals! I also discovered there is a pair of pandas resident in the zoo, but having only just arrived they are being allowed to settle into their new environment, before going on display to the public in December.

Perfect for the backpacker on a budget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stayed in Chinatown, and had the easiest trip to a hostel from the coach so far - it was right around the corner from where I got dropped off. After an exhausting walk of approximately 50 metres, I arrived at Raizzy's Guesthouse and checked into my eight bed dorm. As sad as it sounds, one of the main reasons for choosing to stay here was the fact they had a plug socket right beside each bunk. Those of you with an iPhone will understand why that little perk is so important to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I arrived in KL, I only really had one item on the agenda, which was a trip up the Petronas Towers. Strangely enough, this didn't actually end up happening due to the relatively high cost, and a very good point I read on a website somewhere. One of the main reasons for going to a place is to get a photo with the iconic landmarks included. It goes without saying, that if you're up the Petronas Towers at the time, you can't really get a great photo with them in! I searched around and discovered a place called the Trader's Hotel, which had a rooftop bar for guests and visitors, with apparently a fantastic view of the towers. Oh, and there was also a pool..... In the bar.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098905716/" title="Kuala Lumpur-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8476/8098905716_aaa5b196b8.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the drinks prices were pretty extortionate, but they did at least have a 'two for one' happy hour deal on beers, and the price was still far cheaper than it would have cost to go up the towers themselves. With views like this, I don't regret my decision one bit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098903954/" title="Kuala Lumpur-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8331/8098903954_497b2e0b2a.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098913047/" title="Kuala Lumpur-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8054/8098913047_8e79788243.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098899468/" title="Kuala Lumpur-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8324/8098899468_4a2cfb2e95.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also a nice park right by the towers! I give this one an official Luke Park Rating of 8/10. Oh, it was slightly let down by grumpy security guard women who wouldn't let me even go near a section of the park being cleaned to get a better photo, despite the fact it wasn't cordoned off. I thought they just ate donuts all day anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098920372/" title="Kuala Lumpur-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8330/8098920372_b02a8111ca.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098907830/" title="Kuala Lumpur-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8326/8098907830_4e2f812a4f.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098916202/" title="Kuala Lumpur-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8043/8098916202_fb7ec94a77.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chinatown was great, I really like going there wherever I'm staying. There's always such a buzz about the place, and Kuala Lumpur was no exception. The popular Petaling Street market was the place to go for all your counterfeit goods, cheap food stuffs and evening drinks. I ate most of my meals here, as the food court provides delicious meals at rock bottom prices. It's also fascinating people-watching, with a hugely diverse array of people roaming the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098920483/" title="Kuala Lumpur-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8468/8098920483_dd952ca46f.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in Chinatown, a few doors down from where I was staying in fact, is the very intricately decorated Sri Mahamariamman Hindu temple. A very impressive view as you walk past on the street:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098928164/" title="Kuala Lumpur-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8055/8098928164_c64fbb668d.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point during my meandering around I noticed what appeared to be a monk walking towards me in the opposite direction. Nothing out of the ordinary there, you often see them in countries here, but what followed was certainly unusual. He stopped me as we passed, and held out his hand whilst holding a small trinket of some kind, promising good luck should I take it. I vaguely recalled hearing or reading of something similar, whereby a "monk" (i.e. fake scam artist) would offer you a sticker or something small and once you'd accepted the "gift", they would demand money for it. Remembering this story, I politely declined, and we both went our separate ways. I'm convinced that had I accepted what was offered, I would have found myself in a tricky situation. A narrow escape, and one that could so easily have turned out very differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merdeka Square is where the Malysian flag was first raised in 1957, signifying independence from British rule. Very nice buildings around this area, and a national history museum with a very impressive scale model of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098959911/" title="Kuala Lumpur-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8044/8098959911_0ce4fb64cd.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098955913/" title="Kuala Lumpur-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8473/8098955913_13cf534b77.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098954403/" title="Kuala Lumpur-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8329/8098954403_0b636a4270.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098963167/" title="Kuala Lumpur-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8046/8098963167_2948d207c8.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8098964801/" title="Kuala Lumpur-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8328/8098964801_16f7bc0a15.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short walk from Merdeka Square finds another treat for nature lovers, the botanical gardens. Another great place to come if you need a hit of calm after a stressful day in the city.

Not because I disliked the place, but due to the best coach I've ever been on! The seats were literally like armchairs, and were so wide they only had three in each row, where you'd usually get four. The legroom was amazing too. Possibly the best thing about it however, was the massaging seats. I'd not been on a coach I didn't actually want to get off until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/5303144702958239967/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/11/kuala-lumpur.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5303144702958239967'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5303144702958239967'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/11/kuala-lumpur.html' title='Kuala Lumpur'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2921259539872716194</id><published>2012-10-09T14:35:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-10-09T14:35:56.375+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Taman Negara'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Malaysia'/><title type='text'>Taman Negara</title><content type='html'>Ok have One Direction actually taken over the world? I come to Taman Negara, a national park three hours boat ride away from civilisation, and I hear their song playing on the radio in the local restaurant (shack). I also heard someone in Penang singing it too. So annoying. What's even more annoying is it gets stuck in my head and repeats for hours after the event. It's like a form of torture by terrible music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You don't knowwww, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey to get to Taman Negara from the Cameron Highlands consisted of a few hours in a minibus - I was the only one apart from the driver! - to Jerentut. From there another half an hour or so to a jetty on the Tahan river, where a boat was waiting to continue the journey for three hours upriver to the village of Kuala Tahan. Not the simplest of places to get to, but I was soon to discover it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Everyone else in the room can see it..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat was long and thin, made up of around ten rows of pairs of seats (not exactly seats, but a padded mat across the bottom of the boat, and another to lean against). As I'm obviously travelling alone, I got sat next to another guy in the same boat - pun intended - for the journey. His name was Christoph, and he was also from Germany (I've met so many Germans on my travels it's ridiculous). We ended up staying at the same hostel together, so naturally ended up planning to trek as a pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Everyone else but you..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first day eased me in gently. We had planned a round trip route to a canopy walkway, and a big hill called Bukit Teresek. Approximately 10km in total. No problem. The view from the canopy and the top of the hill alike were very pleasant. Well worth the effort. I felt like I was on "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here" walking across those walkways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059950057/" title="Taman Negara-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8034/8059950057_837922e951.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059966014/" title="Taman Negara-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8178/8059966014_c6f5c48f12.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060037733/" title="Taman Negara-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8182/8060037733_f94a0ebb71.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060045366/" title="Taman Negara-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/8060045366_938b0aef3a.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060090171/" title="Taman Negara-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/8060090171_428da306d8.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060085698/" title="Taman Negara-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/8060085698_ae61f10741.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Baby you light up my world like nobody else..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also learnt on that first day my initial reaction when seeing a snake in the wild is not to run away screaming like a girl, but to reach down for my camera and try and get a photo. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. As it turns out, the photo I did get was absolutely rubbish: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060128646/" title="Taman Negara-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8322/8060128646_6866765950.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's the silver horizontal line you can see in the centre of the shot... I know, I know...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I showed it to one of the park wardens, he was (rightly so) less than impressed with my efforts, but advised it was probably a paradise tree snake. Looking on google I think he's right, as they appear to have a yellow underbelly which you can make out in my photo. They're not venomous apparently, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We saw lots more animals that first day, from the relatively small termites and ants (which are still bloody massive by London standards!), to an iguana type lizard thing (actual name), and monkeys when we got back to the village beating each other up! Check the one on the right with blood dripping from his face... nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060123351/" title="Taman Negara-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/8060123351_364bf1dff3.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060031500/" title="Taman Negara-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/8060031500_97c1e51c12.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059970410/" title="Taman Negara-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/8059970410_81780e997d.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059953935/" title="Taman Negara-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8177/8059953935_4111c2d42b.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060020577/" title="Taman Negara-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/8060020577_80dfcef450.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently there's tigers, leopards, panthers and elephants in the forest here. In fact, there definitely is - the park wardens have photos of them stuck up on the wall, snapped by the automatic cameras as they walk past the sensors. We didn't see anything quite that exciting, just the above animals, and weird trees 'n stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059958539/" title="Taman Negara-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/8059958539_9e2f6cebdc.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060072286/" title="Taman Negara-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/8060072286_58995b17dc.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060066476/" title="Taman Negara-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8171/8060066476_53a7751cec.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060077538/" title="Taman Negara-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8182/8060077538_8377ca10f1.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060081589/" title="Taman Negara-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8036/8060081589_69b3c23f68.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You don't know... oh oh..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reward ourselves for our first day trekking we settled down to a delicious five star beer at the five star resort they have right at the entrance of the park... the one you have to walk right through and gaze at the nice, clean bungalows longingly as you head out to the trails. In case you were wondering, a five star beer is one that looks and tastes exactly the same as a normal beer, but costs literally five times as much. As we were sitting there drinking, we heard music behind us. We turned round to witness a musical welcome, plus free cold towel and drink for some new guests that had just arrived. I wasn't jealous in the slightest.... OK I was a little bit. But it just goes to show how much I could be spending on this trip if I were doing things the "normal" package holiday way. We finished our beers and headed back over by boat to the peasant's side of the river, to our zero star dorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You don't know you're beautiful..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night we'd booked to go on a 4x4 night safari through a huge palm oil plantation. You can also do a walking version, but apparently the one in the truck is the better option as you cover more ground, and have a better chance of seeing more animals that way. And see them we did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060014181/" title="Taman Negara-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8040/8060014181_f108fd2a25.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060005467/" title="Taman Negara-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8312/8060005467_02d96a7aaa.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060001099/" title="Taman Negara-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8040/8060001099_4209e92263.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;An owl that actually swooped down in front of the truck, before settling on a branch, rudely facing away from the camera...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the above, we also saw foxes, wild pigs, and a leopard cat. This is a small wild cat with leopard style camouflage, hence the name. Unfortunately these guys were all too quick to get any photos. They would freeze momentarily under the glare of the guide's bright spotlight, but then slowly move off and under cover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If only you saw what I can see..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently tigers have also been spotted here, very rarely - during the rainy season as they head through towards the river, with the national park on the other side. When that happens though, the truck drives off at great speed, as the back of it where the customers sit is completely open! Meals on wheels...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day we had something altogether more ambitious planned. We were going to trek for a similar distance to the day before, but this time sleep overnight in Kumbang hide, before returning via a different route the morning after. Sleeping overnight is a completely different story when it comes to what you need to take with you. You need at least three big bottles of water (I actually would have liked to have one more), a sleeping bag (I rented one), food, a change of clothes... all of this means you have a seriously heavy bag to start out with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we left something really annoyed me as well, I bought a hydration pack for my main backpack before I left - its a waterproof bag you fill with water, with a hose (like a straw) that comes over your shoulder and attaches to a small mouthpiece for you to drink from. It saves you having to reach round for a bottle all the time. I'd barely used it the whole trip, so I was pleased I would finally be able to use it in anger. I filled it, put it in my bag and Christoph and I went for some breakfast. When we returned, the dorm room floor was completely soaked. Straight in the bin went the leaky piece of rubbish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You'd understand why I want you so desperately..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with the trek wasn't bad at all, I was full of energy and we were making good progress. We soon caught up another bunch of trekkers, who we discovered were also heading to the same hide, so we all walked together. Around the halfway point, we came across a really nice stream with a natural pool where we all took a well earned swim. I needed it by that point as well, I was beginning to struggle and I was literally dripping with sweat. My shorts were no wetter after getting in the water than they were before, that's how bad it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few more kilometres, I was starting to feel like I may have bitten off more than I could chew! The distance isn't the problem, it's the terrain you're covering. You are constantly clambering up and down as you cross lots of different streams making their way down to the river. I think five months of doing nothing has made me unfit too, as most of the group were doing well. A couple of others were also struggling though. When we finally made it to the hide, those two were already certain they were not trekking back the following morning, but making their way to a nearby lodge, where a boat could be taken back to the village. I wanted to see how I felt after some food and sleep, so I left it until the following morning before making my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hide itself was extremely basic, but very cool. When we arrived I was completely and utterly exhausted and in no mood at all to be taking photos, so I've stolen one of the outside from the Internet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8070494565/" title="Camera Roll-247 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8172/8070494565_e6d816100e.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-247"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside were twelve wooden, double deck bunks, where you could roll out your sleeping mat and sleeping bag. Trust me when I say, this was probably the most uncomfortable bed I've had on my journey so far! There was a long, thin window in one wall, with a wooden bench next to it where you could sit and look out over a salt lick in the forest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8060139026/" title="Taman Negara-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/8060139026_47f0dee5a6.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You don't know... oh oh..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We saw a couple of animals while we were there, tapirs and some kind of an eagle I think. It would sit in the tree and occasionally we'd see it swoop down and grab some prey from the forest floor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059974513/" title="Taman Negara-33 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8041/8059974513_ccfc7c36ee.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-33"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059978397/" title="Taman Negara-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8320/8059978397_ff720b1e03.jpg" alt="Taman Negara-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very coolest thing for me though, is during one of the countless times I woke up during the night/early morning, in the far distance I heard an elephant trumpet, and five minutes later the same thing but for longer. The sound carried so far through the jungle, and it was really incredible to hear whilst lying in bed! Sadly we didn't see any while we were there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning I wussed out and got the boat back. My legs were aching simply walking up the steps of the hide, there was no way I could manage another 10km! I got back, had a nice long shower, changed into some clean clothes and did absolutely nothing for the rest of the day! And it felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You don't know you're beautiful!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post was bought to you by Luke Twomey, featuring One Direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8070616874/" title="Camera Roll-249 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8175/8070616874_682c7f5a05.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-249"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2921259539872716194/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/10/taman-negara.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2921259539872716194'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2921259539872716194'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/10/taman-negara.html' title='Taman Negara'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1339491833049908545</id><published>2012-10-08T09:15:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-10-08T09:15:01.753+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Malaysia'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Tanah Rata'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='The Cameron Highlands'/><title type='text'>Tanah Rata, The Cameron Highlands</title><content type='html'>Getting to Tanah Rata didn't go very smoothly. The bus arrived on time, no problem there. In fact I was overjoyed with what I saw. there were huge, comfortable seats, with masses of legroom! It was by far the nicest coach I've been on yet. The problem came when we stopped off at a bus station for ten (scheduled) minutes to set down and pick up more passengers. I returned from the toilet to find an official looking pickup truck with police style lights mounted on the top, and some stern faced guys in uniform (I guess the Malaysian transport police) chatting to our driver. There appeared to be some concern with the door of our coach, which didn't quite shut fully, and required securing in order to stop it from opening further as we were driving along. I guess we were waiting around for 30-45 minutes while everyone had a big conversation about this door, opening and closing it, pulling and pushing it countless times. I was fully expecting them to say we couldn't go any further, when suddenly the police wandered off, the driver jumped in his seat and off we set! Lucky escape, I thought, except that wasn't quite the end. As we drew nearer to our final destination, the bus pulled over to the side of the road and the driver told us the police also weren't too happy with the state of one of his tyres. They'd also apparently told him a couple of times before about this, and insisted it be changed immediately... next thing we knew we were being jacked up and you could hear the sound of wheel guns as the wheel was removed and replaced with another. Coming from other countries in Asia, this was a refreshing change, where there was absolutely no policing of buses or minibuses at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanah Rata itself is very scenic, with nice views of the surrounding hills everywhere you look. It actually reminded me of one of those American towns you see so often on screen, like in Twin Peaks or Twilight, with the trees everywhere it had that kind of feel to it. Although admittedly I've never been personally, just seen them on screen. It also had a very nice park (yes I love my parks!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058781673/" title="Penang-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8029/8058781673_ee93c44db3.jpg" alt="Penang-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058772704/" title="Penang-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/8058772704_1341c89648.jpg" alt="Penang-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058888434/" title="Tanah Rata-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8177/8058888434_190ffc3b5c.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059194037/" title="Tanah Rata-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8174/8059194037_1889bf62a7.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058895897/" title="Tanah Rata-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8058895897_04e2ef934b.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058886354/" title="Tanah Rata-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8058886354_43217417cc.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058899832/" title="Tanah Rata-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8058899832_784db024f1.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058907269/" title="Tanah Rata-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8058907269_01ea2b38bc.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059097932/" title="Tanah Rata-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8450/8059097932_7189f3db05.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058912495/" title="Tanah Rata-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8058912495_9026dc51f6.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On arriving I went to a few different places to find a cheap and cheerful hostel that had space for me in their dorm. Kang's lodge fit the bill, with a nice attic style, wooden beam affair in the roof of their building. At a price of RM 10 (£2), it was not the cheapest I'd been in so far in Asia (but obviously still a relative steal compared to the UK!), but Malaysia in general is more expensive. A taste of things to come, now I'd already visited the cheapest countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I only planned to be in Tanah Rata for one day, I opted to take a half day tour the next day in order to ensure I saw all the local highlights. In actual fact, the tour was only ok, not brilliant. It didn't get off to the best of starts when we took a trip up to Gunung Brinchang to get a view from the highest point in Malaysia, at 6,666 feet above sea level. Unfortunately it was cloudy, so despite climbing a purpose built viewing platform, we had no view to enjoy. Disappointing, but these things happen. The views slightly further down, however, were still amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059199601/" title="Tanah Rata-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/8059199601_2a7a9de560.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059231709/" title="Tanah Rata-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8032/8059231709_3505f7f765.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059561194/" title="Tanah Rata-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8318/8059561194_b5444f1613.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058861680/" title="Tanah Rata-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8179/8058861680_fc67ac858b.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were gazing across a tea plantation, owned by a Scottish family and employing more than two hundred workers. The tea is cut every three weeks, as only the light green, new leaves can be used to make tea. A clever device is used which allows the workers to harvest ten times more than they would by cutting manually. They drag it over the top of the trees and the leaves get blown into the bag at the back. Unfortunately the tea factory was closed on Mondays, when I'd booked the tour (I knew this at the time), so we couldn't go in to have a look at how it's processed once it's cut. I'm sure we could have had free tasters had we been able to visit, but as many of you will know, I don't drink tea anyway (I am English, believe it or not) so I wasn't too disappointed there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After coming down from the hills in a trusty 1988 Land Rover (still going strong!) we visited a butterfly farm. This was fairly average. There were a lot of butterflies there but they all seemed to be more or less the same species. There were some nice flowers though, always an easy photo opportunity, and a really cool tortoise:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059720001/" title="Tanah Rata-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8041/8059720001_6771f069f5.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059724241/" title="Tanah Rata-35 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8457/8059724241_05ffe0d897.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-35"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059732954/" title="Tanah Rata-37 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8029/8059732954_4fc707f0ae.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059780544/" title="Tanah Rata-39 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8059780544_d01494aa22.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-39"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059785244/" title="Tanah Rata-40 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8035/8059785244_6ff2b06b8a.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059838306/" title="Tanah Rata-43 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/8059838306_ee4b00fa35.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059855365/" title="Tanah Rata-46 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/8059855365_8f275d63ce.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059771736/" title="Tanah Rata-38 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8451/8059771736_be7e6d8006.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-38"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strawberry farm came next. For Lord only knows what reason, there are absolutely loads of strawberry farms in the Cameron Highlands. The area is so famous for strawberries in fact, that the shops have also produced all kinds of strawberry themed souvenirs for the tourists to enjoy. The farm we were visiting had a cafe attached, and with it the promise of cream tea, I naturally had to try some -just the scone mind - but it wasn't a patch on what you would get in England! There were also many other delights you could try. I went for the sundae, and the strawberry chocolate milkshake. They were gooood. I was very full! I also think I've had my strawberry allocation for the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059570393/" title="Tanah Rata-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8172/8059570393_45a0eb77e1.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059862691/" title="Tanah Rata-47 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8318/8059862691_e5cd5cdd57.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-47"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059581548/" title="Tanah Rata-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/8059581548_640d91ed72.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059867129/" title="Tanah Rata-48 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8041/8059867129_0f560afb9c.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-48"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last stop was a Buddhist temple. This was ok. It looked very similar to other temples I've seen along the way... the best was yet to come though, and strangely it wasn't a part of the tour! Behind the temple was the start of a jungle trek, which we could follow for a couple of hours in order to get back to the town. At least, it would have taken us that length of time if we hadn't got lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour guide dropped off three of us there (all actually staying in the same hostel) and we were given instructions to follow paths two, three, then five. Easy. The problem was, at the end of path two there were two directions to choose from. Left was marked as path three, and right was also marked as path three. When you join a path in the middle, which way do you go?! The wrong way, of course... like us! We realised our error when we reached a road and there was a sign from there pointing back in the direction we'd came, to path five. Our little detour probably cost us another hour, but it was a fun excursion nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059870515/" title="Tanah Rata-49 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8036/8059870515_725d99d67a.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-49"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059891999/" title="Tanah Rata-53 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8182/8059891999_a14124726b.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-53"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059881644/" title="Tanah Rata-51 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8174/8059881644_54d9b3b897.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-51"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059875938/" title="Tanah Rata-50 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8309/8059875938_613c927230.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059895942/" title="Tanah Rata-54 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8312/8059895942_62762d6534.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-54"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059904200/" title="Tanah Rata-55 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/8059904200_a6449b9c68.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-55"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059914661/" title="Tanah Rata-56 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8059914661_767fa8f2fc.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-56"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059931232/" title="Tanah Rata-59 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/8059931232_1a82386038.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-59"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8059918806/" title="Tanah Rata-57 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/8059918806_508c8679e5.jpg" alt="Tanah Rata-57"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a shame to see (and hear) very large trees being cut down by chainsaw all around us as we were walking. If you've never heard it before, it's a very loud noise when they come crashing to the ground! We could only assume it was to make way for other huge, ugly hotel complexes like those we saw being built in a couple of places along the road. Another example of a town that will no doubt one day become ruined from excessive development and tourism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in a bid to get away from civilisation entirely, my next stop was Taman Negara, the biggest national park in Malaysia, which promised lots more trekking, and the chance to sleep overnight in the middle of the rainforest.

It's quite scary how quickly I'm getting through them now. Time definitely seems to be passing a lot faster than before. I'm sure before i know it I'll be back home seeing all the friends and family I've been missing. Once again I had no plan in mind for Malaysia, other than visiting Kuala Lumpur (affectionately known as KL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Bangkok I had briefly searched for recommended places to visit in Malaysia. Penang was mentioned in almost every link, and is right in the north of the country, ideal for travelling to by sleeper train from neighbouring Thailand. I had found my next destination, but so far this constituted my whole plan for the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point I was also quite far behind in my blog updates. Actually I always seem to be behind by a couple of places at least... often the problem is finding the time to sit down and actually get writing. During the day I'm usually out and about seeing things, or if I'm feeling lazy and like I need a rest, I then don't feel like making my brain work to write my next blog! Buses or trains could be a good call, but I quite like looking out the window then and watching the country pass by. It's nice to see the views as you travel through, however briefly it may be. Penang, therefore, was dedicated to blogging initially - and photo editing and uploading which actually takes considerably more time than the text itself. I also planned out the rest of the time in Malaysia, with the places I'd most like to visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day I did actually venture out to explore, it didn't get off to the best of starts. I wanted to get to Penang Hill, which is a 2411 foot high peak in the centre of the island that gives great views of the area, and across Georgetown, the capital. Being unable to walk there, due to the distance, I googled and discovered I could supposedly get a few different buses to one place, then I should be able to get to Penang Hill from there. However, after waiting for around half an hour at the bus stop, none of those buses had arrived. I boarded the next one, and asked the driver which bus I needed in order to get to Penang Hill... number 204, he said. Thanks Mr. bus driver! I continued waiting... for around 45 minutes. No sign of 204. I boarded another bus and asked the same question, receiving the same response. I continued to wait for another 15-20 minutes before realising it definitely wasn't coming. I googled to find a place I could get to near Penang Hill, and waited for around 30 minutes before a bus to get to that destination finally came. The driver kindly explained to me that bus 204 didn't actually drive down that road, but he would give me a free lift to where it did..... Yes, I was at the bus stop for around 2 hours. Yes, I was waiting in completely the wrong place. No, I have no idea why the previous two drivers had neglected to inform me that I was in fact waiting in entirely the wrong place for the 204. Maybe it's a sick game they play with tourists to see how many times they can laugh at the same person waiting as they complete a round trip of their route?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having finally arrived at Penang Hill, you could see just how steep the train to the top was. It reminded me of the train to get to the top of the peak in Hong Kong, but this train was far more modern. There's much less of a sense you could plummet to your death on this one! A short ride later, the summit was reached, and the views over Georgetown, the capital of Penang, and elsewhere on the island were very good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058615732/" title="Penang-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8036/8058615732_2d14771854.jpg" alt="Penang-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058608559/" title="Penang-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8058608559_f02208056c.jpg" alt="Penang-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058578745/" title="Penang-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8173/8058578745_33e560735a.jpg" alt="Penang-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unexpectedly, at the top they also have various attractions. None of them were particularly interesting, an owl museum which I really regretted paying to enter, a play area for kids (I'm a little too old) and some restaurants. A short walk around the side of the hill and I also discovered a "Monkeycup Garden". These are carnivorous plants which grow a large cup that produces a liquid that drowns stupid  insects that get stuck there. It then eats them. Delicious. Surprisingly there was also the opportunity to get up close and personal with some creepy crawlies. Yes, I was a little more hesitant with the scorpion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058733116/" title="Penang-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8058733116_07ace7628b.jpg" alt="Penang-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058620261/" title="Penang-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/8058620261_615b182152.jpg" alt="Penang-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058790543/" title="Penang-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8179/8058790543_cf6776095a.jpg" alt="Penang-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058790082/" title="Penang-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8037/8058790082_9d46079743.jpg" alt="Penang-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058690818/" title="Penang-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8172/8058690818_5df701a45a.jpg" alt="Penang-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058753225/" title="Penang-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8058753225_14bd8036fd.jpg" alt="Penang-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058755128/" title="Penang-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8454/8058755128_4d62bd2482.jpg" alt="Penang-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monkeys there would go rummaging through the bins searching for tasty food that tourists had discarded. I didn't actually see them steal food from anyone, but I'm sure they do. There was a woman who got stupidly close to the one I photographed eating from the cup, to take a picture. I was poised with the camera to snap away as it jumped at her throat, but sadly it never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058759651/" title="Penang-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8058759651_b4a81b8d03.jpg" alt="Penang-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058573843/" title="Penang-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/8058573843_3ff2363387.jpg" alt="Penang-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the train down from Bangkok I had met a German guy called Louis. As we were headed to the same place, we took the ferry across to Penang island together and searched for a cheap guesthouse. We found one called "Love Lane Inn" with a twin room for a reasonable price, so decided to share. Despite the romantic name, and the private room, nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to convince him to buy a bike to travel on for the rest of his journey. Actually he didn't take much convincing, I just mentioned I'd done the same in Vietnam, loved it... and that was all he needed to hear! He already knew how to ride from home, but unfortunately he wasn't in the best position to buy a bike. Vietnam is crawling with "proper" bikes, (clutch, gears etc). Presumably because so many people do what I did there, and some of the mountain roads really require that type of machine. Penang, however, was full of scooters and very little else. Even a trip over to the mainland and a search in the main town there, Butterworth, was unsuccessful. They had manual bikes, but not within budget. When I left he was still searching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgetown (the capital) is very multi cultural. Indians, Malaysians and Chinese combine to make a very diverse population. This mix also means the food in Penang is amazing, with plenty of good places to eat wherever you go. The best places are street stalls and night markets/food courts where you will get the authentic food as it should be eaten. Red Garden food court is a great place, with hundreds of plastic tables and (red) chairs in the middle of a large food court, surrounded by a large number of kitchens serving different cuisines, Malaysian, Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Thai... each of them has pictures of their food on large signs at their counters, with set prices. Just go up, and place an order with your table number. When they bring it to your table you pay. There is the added extra of live entertainment while you eat. A stage in one corner of the court is surrounded by the tables, and every night a musician (or musicians) play music and sing for your pleasure. Most of them don't have the best voice, admittedly... but there were occasionally some attractive girls to make up for the not so great singing... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also a fantastic Chinese "restaurant" - open front, metal tables and plastic chairs - called Tek Sen which served fantastic food for very reasonable prices. Louis and I both agreed it was the best we ate at. Expect dishes like sweet and sour chicken, double roasted pork, deep fried chicken in shrimp paste, sichuan ribs, soy fried fish... I could go on, but my mouth is watering all over my iPhone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I can no longer type due to a saliva related incident, I will wrap this up and return with my next update from the Cameron Highlands, and a village called Tanah Rata.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/4010377334547375995/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/10/penang-malaysia.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/4010377334547375995'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/4010377334547375995'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/10/penang-malaysia.html' title='Penang, Malaysia'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1033013725561932510</id><published>2012-10-06T14:25:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-10-06T14:25:24.248+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Thailand'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Bangkok'/><title type='text'>Bangkok</title><content type='html'>I had no ladyboy encounters. I know that's the first thing many of you will be dying to know, so let me just disappoint you right out the gate. Or maybe I've already repressed it? Perhaps one day horrific memories of activities like in The Hangover 2 movie will come flooding back to haunt me. Well, until then I can remain blissfully unaware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bangkok is big. I know that sounds completely ridiculous to say about a city like that, but I think I've just become so accustomed to places where I can wander along for a couple of kilometres and find pretty much all I need. They have an excellent MRT underground, linked to a Skytrain system riding above the congested roads below, which is a quick, reliable way to get around, and used by many. Expect London rush hour scenes on the trains though, they're that popular. I was always able to get on the first train that arrived however, despite long queues. Yes, queues! I know that's an alien concept for anyone who's travelled on public transport in London at rush hour, but they do actually exist - and in Hong Kong too. People form neat, orderly lines at designated points along the platform, and enter the train in that manner when it arrives. No pushing here folks. Judging by previous status updates from my Facebook friends about London transport that would definitely go down well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029158592/" title="Bangkok-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8457/8029158592_24cef9c07c.jpg" alt="Bangkok-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029168222/" title="Bangkok-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8461/8029168222_1e0dc0288f.jpg" alt="Bangkok-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029172286/" title="Bangkok-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/8029172286_32f8f630ea.jpg" alt="Bangkok-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met up with Ella as planned, and it was really nice to see her again. She'd been to Bangkok before, so I toured the usual sights before she arrived. The Grand Palace was my first stop. Whilst it is undeniably grand, the sheer number of people visiting meant it was extremely crowded, and virtually impossible to get a photo without someone walking in front of you! I am sure I was guilty of this myself though, it's so busy it's something you can't avoid. I know I'm also one of the many people who decided to visit, so I'm really not in a position to complain... it's just a shame when something becomes so popular that it detracts from the experience of going there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029414717/" title="Bangkok-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8037/8029414717_86a17c0d1f.jpg" alt="Bangkok-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029395491/" title="Bangkok-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8177/8029395491_b24a80e7b9.jpg" alt="Bangkok-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029417345/" title="Bangkok-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/8029417345_c7d59512e4.jpg" alt="Bangkok-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;He looks happy...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029417574/" title="Bangkok-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/8029417574_6a684d3abe.jpg" alt="Bangkok-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yep, he's definitely had enough...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029394432/" title="Bangkok-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8035/8029394432_873909696c.jpg" alt="Bangkok-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029401953/" title="Bangkok-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8461/8029401953_4dcc3f3bb0.jpg" alt="Bangkok-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029406789/" title="Bangkok-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8313/8029406789_8c2a30babc.jpg" alt="Bangkok-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029151983/" title="Camera Roll-265 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8452/8029151983_5bb534acb4.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-265"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a walk to the infamous Khao San road while I was in the area. This is backpacker central, and the number of guesthouses, food stalls, souvenir shops, bars and conmen that accompany that is mind blowing. I walked along, ignoring the many people trying to tailor me a suit (been to Hoi An already, sorry!), the Indian "psychics" informing me I was a "lucky man" and the restaurant promotors, before stopping at a Pad Thai stall to sample the street food. It was ok, but I've definitely had better elsewhere. It gave me time to soak up the atmosphere though. I was amused at the signs advertising fake id's, diplomas etc for sale, similarly the bar actually named "We do not check ID card", but I didn't really like it very much. Far too crowded and chaotic for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029427178/" title="Bangkok-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/8029427178_f14c9ceb9f.jpg" alt="Bangkok-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the vicinity of the palace are Wat Pho and Wat Arun. By the time I'd returned to that area from Khao San road, storm clouds were gathering and thunder could be heard in the distance. Before the rain arrived I grabbed some quick snaps before working out how to get back to the Skytrain. Unfortunately the river taxi I'd taken to get to the palace initially was no longer running due to some unknown event on the river. I had no idea which bus to get, so was left with little option but to jump in a taxi. This was a complete pain, as seemingly none of the taxi drivers in Bangkok actually want to use the meter. They insist on agreeing a set (vastly inflated) price at the start of the journey, in order to extort more money from unsuspecting tourists. I went through about six different taxis before finally hailing one who was happy to turn on the meter for me. The fare at the end was only about a third of the price of one of the highest amounts I'd been offered previously... demand the meter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029435939/" title="Bangkok-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8460/8029435939_3fdfb0154e.jpg" alt="Bangkok-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the many shopping malls in the Sukhumvit area, I had the best toilet experience of my life. And no, it wasn't spending some quality time with one of the many stunning, sexy girls walking around in heels and tight dresses...  I needed a poo. Bear with me here... it's worth it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029156266/" title="Bangkok-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8029/8029156266_41017caa9b.jpg" alt="Bangkok-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029164662/" title="Bangkok-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8315/8029164662_61241bc6db.jpg" alt="Bangkok-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad I needed a poo at that particular moment, otherwise I never would have experienced the wonder of the Terminal 21 shopping mall's best toilet in the world. I entered the stall, and this is what lay before me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058568190/" title="Bangkok-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/8058568190_da81c39552.jpg" alt="Bangkok-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8058566220/" title="Bangkok-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8179/8058566220_d81127a42a.jpg" alt="Bangkok-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, I took photos of the toilet...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew immediately this was going to be special. I sat down, and my first treat was instantly warm buttocks. The seat was heated... and not the kind of warmth you might experience after a big, hairy guy has just visited the commode before you... this was hot. It felt right on so many levels. The next delight was a hot water bidet. For those that don't know, a bidet is a jet of water that is used to wash your arse after you've laid some pipe. I'd already sampled this unique experience by using the "bum guns" found in a lot of Asian toilets. Same deal, but it's a gun attached to a hose that you have to pick up and aim at your arse. And it's cold water. This was at the touch of the button, and hot. I didn't think it could get any better... until I saw the button marked "Dry". Guess what that did... Told you it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also took a trip to the aquarium in the basement of the Paragon shopping mall, which I had a refreshed interest in after having just completed my scuba course:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029179753/" title="Bangkok-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8313/8029179753_25d4e2c79f.jpg" alt="Bangkok-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029183245/" title="Bangkok-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/8029183245_49ae662ebe.jpg" alt="Bangkok-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029184136/" title="Bangkok-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8179/8029184136_83549a931c.jpg" alt="Bangkok-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029193387/" title="Bangkok-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/8029193387_ccb31c08c2.jpg" alt="Bangkok-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029191072/" title="Bangkok-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/8029191072_1161f273cf.jpg" alt="Bangkok-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029230391/" title="Bangkok-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8037/8029230391_142c4215d5.jpg" alt="Bangkok-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029341078/" title="Bangkok-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8461/8029341078_05a4b7e8bc.jpg" alt="Bangkok-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029344650/" title="Bangkok-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8450/8029344650_55707fb509.jpg" alt="Bangkok-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029352189/" title="Bangkok-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/8029352189_40c30bf41a.jpg" alt="Bangkok-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029387413/" title="Bangkok-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8310/8029387413_f7f5b59a3a.jpg" alt="Bangkok-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After experiencing Bangkok, I was ready to cross borders once again, and Malaysia was next on the agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1033013725561932510/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/10/bangkok.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1033013725561932510'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1033013725561932510'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/10/bangkok.html' title='Bangkok'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5467639720973604098</id><published>2012-09-28T15:44:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-09-28T15:44:13.204+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Koh Tao'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Thailand'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Koh Tao</title><content type='html'>Scuba diving baby! Koh Tao is THE place to dive in Thailand. It has the best dive sites, and I've also heard getting certified there can work out two or three times cheaper than elsewhere in the world. It's on the south east coast, so I actually had to pass through Bangkok to get there, before going back up to see Ella later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To travel south, I opted for the relative comfort of a sleeper train. I'd quite enjoyed my time on one when I was in Vietnam, in a nerdy, childish kind of way. The first one I booked took me from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, where I spent half a day before boarding another to go to Chumphon, before finally sailing on a ferry to Koh Tao. The train has comfy seats in booths either side of a central aisle during the day, with train staff changing them transformers style into beds by night. These little compartments are awesome fun, when the curtain is drawn it feels like you're in a fort like when you were a little kid. Yes, believe it or not I'm actually 27 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029093683/" title="Chiang Mai-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/8029093683_100f8a0910.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029088026/" title="Chiang Mai-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/8029088026_e0ee64594a.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029088963/" title="Chiang Mai-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8320/8029088963_9b250dd72b.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029034992/" title="Chiang Mai-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/8029034992_107ffea604.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8028975750/" title="Koh Tao-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/8028975750_6b19e2152c.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8028984207/" title="Koh Tao-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/8028984207_f2056f781b.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On disembarking, I hunted through the crowd of taxi/moto drivers, guest house touts and dive people for Ban's dive school. This company owns Sunshine Divers, and a glowing recommendation from Rob saw me heading straight to their resort on the south of the island on a free moto arranged by the Ban's lady. A nice coincidence meant the two instructors hanging around there when I arrived were Bastiaan and his wife Kim. Bastiaan had taught Rob and Gilly while they were there, so it was nice to be learning with him. It also meant comparisons could easily be made - at the end he said I was the most bestest and awesomest diver he'd ever seen (sorry Rob, sorry Gilly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within ten minutes of arriving, I was sat down watching the enthralling instructional videos accompanying each chapter I had to read in the manual. Yep, that's right folks, a textbook. This is followed by knowledge reviews of each section, with a final exam at the end of it all. It felt like I was back at school! You can dive without certification, but this will be a one off shallower dive. By passing your PADI Open Water diving course, you can then dive all over the world and to a depth of 18 metres, 30 metres if you go on to do the advanced course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day I returned, having completed my homework (yes, it just got worse), to meet my "buddy" for the duration of the course, Eliza. Eliza is from Germany and had been on Koh Samui with two of her friends, but needed a little alone time so headed off to Tao for the diving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8028987446/" title="Koh Tao-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/8028987446_65d5be42f8.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dream Team, Bastiaan, me and Eliza...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maximum class size with Sunshine is four, but as it is low season, it was just Eliza and I being taught by Bastiaan. When diving, you must always have a "buddy" who you dive with, in case you get into an emergency underwater. The main thing is being able to use their secondary regulator to breathe air from their tank if you experience a problem with yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our first day we headed off to the swimming pool, where we had to prove to Bastiaan we could actually swim (apparently some people don't actually realise this is a requirement!) and then began our introduction to diving. My immediate reaction when first descending below the surface was one of mild panic. After breathing out fully for the first time underwater, my brain told me it would be impossible to regain my breath. It took me a little while to get used to the fact I could breathe without a problem underwater. It did feel very unnatural though. We practised skills including removing the regulator from your mouth, and learning the correct technique to retrieve it, and removing your face mask and replacing it, before blowing through your nose in order to clear the water from it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day was where the really fun stuff began. We'd graduated from the pool, it was time to get in the boat and head out to sea! Our first dive was at Hin Ngam. It took an age for me to descend to the bottom, as I was having some trouble equalising. You have to do this as you go down, otherwise your ears will start causing you pain due to the water pressure. It's the same kind of thing as when you fly in a plane and have to swallow so you hear them pop. Once we got down there though, it really was something else. I quickly forgot about any problems I'd been having with my ears, as I was completely distracted by the underwater world I was now in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982855235/" title="Koh Tao-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8032/7982855235_7fbf9c9c13.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983070334/" title="Koh Tao-41 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8313/7983070334_75010a2fe4.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-41"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983105025/" title="Koh Tao-45 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7983105025_50952b81cf.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-45"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983139287/" title="Koh Tao-50 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8181/7983139287_40fe3ac82b.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982850830/" title="Koh Tao-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7982850830_36a0d29282.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was tricky at first to actually swim horizontally, as bizarre as that sounds. I had a tendency to always be swimming upwards slightly. By the end of the dive though, it was coming far more naturally to me. We surfaced and Bastiaan seemed pretty happy with his "Dream Team". The next dive that day merely served to reinforce the techniques we'd already set in place, and by the end of the day we felt like expert divers! Certainly compared to when we first entered the water... My ears were still giving me a problem though, but Bastiaan said he had a magic pill I could take which would open up my airways a bit before the next dive the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alarm was set for 6:30 again  (certainly not something I'd been used to doing on my trip so far, but a nice reminder of what I had to look forward to when I returned home again!), and we sailed out to our next dive site, Red Rock. On the way we were treated to a lovely display of vomit from Bastiaan... We had a guy on board called Chris who was taking his rescue dive course at the time. He basically had to know how to handle every kind of dive emergency on (and off) the boat you could imagine. On this occasion, it was Bastiaan. And vomit. All down the front of his body. Nice. I genuinely believed he had actually made himself physically sick, just to give that added sense of realism to the acting as he threw up over Chris, but I later found out it was only cookies and tea or something like that. It looked very, very real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this dive we got to see a banded sea snake, which was very cool. It was only when we resurfaced and Bastiaan told us that one bite could easily kill us, that it became less so! I was also introduced to a character I'd come to get intimately acquainted with on a later dive - the trigger fish. These guys are extremely territorial, and when they feel threatened a small trigger will pop up on their back. They also have teeth....... On this particular occasion I was swimming after Bastiaan when he signalled me to come towards him, what appeared to be urgently. The next thing I knew I felt a tug on my fin (you're not allowed to call them flippers). I honestly thought I was about to be eaten by a shark. I was too terrified to even look behind me to see what it was! I just knew it wasn't Eliza as she was right next to me, also swimming away at great speed! When we were above water, I discovered it was this type of fish that had bitten my fin as I was swimming across his territory. We would meet again....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982880450/" title="Koh Tao-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8171/7982880450_d6becc1612.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the following dive we saw a turtle steadily ripping away at the coral looking for food. It was amazing, I'm just gutted we didn't have the camera that time. There was also a motorbike (not something you'd usually expect!), and a deliberately wrecked catamaran. On this occasion it was my turn to navigate, using a compass and a hand drawn map of the dive site on a slate. I actually did surprisingly well, leading us around a set route and finishing within around twenty feet of where we were meant to be. Not bad for a first attempt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the modules I chose to do as part of the advanced course was "Peak Performance Buoyancy". This is basically fine tuning your buoyancy in the water and learning to better control your movement underwater. It was also a good excuse to have lots of fun at an underwater playground!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982518386/" title="Camera Roll-321 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8442/7982518386_250010f42d.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-321"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982791151/" title="Koh Tao-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8310/7982791151_3d94201225.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982806534/" title="Koh Tao-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/7982806534_e25b11fd06.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982809412/" title="Koh Tao-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8460/7982809412_5bdc4c7aed.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982829992/" title="Koh Tao-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/7982829992_a70046ebe3.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982781873/" title="Koh Tao-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8450/7982781873_d1db33b808.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7982833662/" title="Koh Tao-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/7982833662_1863f69136.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bastiaan...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="225" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=233cd815c2&amp;photo_id=7984648298"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=233cd815c2&amp;photo_id=7984648298" height="225" width="400"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It figures that following something fun, there had to be something not so fun. Like getting bitten on the finger and the ankle by a trigger fish. We were busy looking at another one, when I felt something tugging on my finger. Thinking it was Bastiaan messing around, I turned to see a much larger trigger fish (Dad!) attached to my finger. He then removed himself and attacked my leg. It hurt.... they have teeth! But I was more worried about it being poisonous. Bastiaan assured me it was ok though. Even so, I got a weird numb/tingling feeling in my foot as if I'd had an injection like you'd have at the dentist, but the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. I really wanted to hunt that fish down and fry him up for dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983072412/" title="Koh Tao-42 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7983072412_ab82fc84fc.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-42"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983070995/" title="Koh Tao-43 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/7983070995_a4f71d3709.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983273835/" title="Koh Tao-65 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8036/7983273835_d49cd1dd51.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-65"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983264766/" title="Koh Tao-64 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8042/7983264766_594f8b98ba.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-64"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7983245533/" title="Koh Tao-62 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8439/7983245533_aedbb6598c.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-62"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final dive was a night dive, which I must admit I was most nervous about. It seems slightly mad to throw yourself off a completely satisfactory boat into the middle of a pitch black sea... we did it though, and it was pretty incredible. We saw things which we never would have seen during the day, like hermit crabs, barracudas hunting, stingrays, a moray eel. The best thing of all is trigger fish sleep at night! We also stopped at one point and turned off our torches, then waved our arms around in front of us, which gave an incredible light show of green bioluminescent plankton illuminating in front of us, it really was spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having earned my "Advanced Open Water Diver" title, I was free to relax on the beautiful beach at the dive resort for a few more days, before heading back to Bangkok to meet Ella who was flying in on the 21st September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029004466/" title="Koh Tao-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8179/8029004466_e787e8a97e.jpg" alt="Koh Tao-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunshine Dive Resort...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8032810934/" title="Camera Roll-186 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/8032810934_7b3e006556.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-186"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/5467639720973604098/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/09/koh-tao.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5467639720973604098'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5467639720973604098'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/09/koh-tao.html' title='Koh Tao'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1849077619983491488</id><published>2012-09-28T05:02:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-09-28T05:02:48.367+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Chiang Mai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Thailand'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Chiang Mai</title><content type='html'>Thailand. Specifically Chiang Mai, "Cultural capital".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately on arriving in Thailand, it felt more developed and 'westernised'. The roads were smoother, and three lanes wide at some points, allowing for motorway speeds. When we stopped for a break it was at what you'd consider a "proper" petrol garage/service station. There were more glass fronted shops, and big superstores... it was vastly different to the previous countries I'd been to. That's not always a good thing, of course...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029037093/" title="Chiang Mai-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8035/8029037093_abe99b913e.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029032453/" title="Chiang Mai-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8040/8029032453_e70ecd74b8.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chiang Mai is just nice. It's a pleasant, calming place to be. The quaint little soi's (lanes) host charming daily Thai life, from women hanging out their washing to kids fighting with sticks. I stayed in the old city, which is a 4 square km piece of land surrounded by a moat. The size of it makes it easy to walk around, safe in the knowledge you'll never actually get lost, merely take a slight diversion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029025785/" title="Chiang Mai-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/8029025785_61757f0f16.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029028397/" title="Chiang Mai-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8032/8029028397_21fb6b3fdc.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029092542/" title="Chiang Mai-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8029/8029092542_ffcbe1a54b.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029098209/" title="Chiang Mai-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8031/8029098209_f09bf835cc.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029104060/" title="Chiang Mai-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8182/8029104060_a0706b24b4.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived in Chiang Mai with not the faintest idea about how long I'd be staying there, or even where else in Thailand I'd be heading (besides the obligatory Bangkok). Four days later I still hadn't made any plans. Chiang Mai made me lazy! OK... lazier than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stupidest thing actually amazed me on my first day here, so much so I just have to mention it briefly. I've become so accustomed to pedestrian crossings meaning precisely bugger all in Southeast Asia, that I nearly collapsed in shock when a car actually stopped to let me cross a road, and I wasn't even at a crossing! I guess that's proof the drivers are nicer in Thailand... or Chiang Mai at least. You really do have to see some of the antics on the roads here in Asia to believe them. The scary thing is, I've been here so long now they actually just seem normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chiang Mai is also apparently home to the world's smallest dog. You may have to enlarge the photo (click it) to actually see it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029099274/" title="Chiang Mai-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8040/8029099274_3f2e301750.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's actually a rat...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, what's the point of having a dog that tiny?! I'd be paranoid I was going to crush it every time I crashed out on the sofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Chiang Mai as a place to just relax after Laos. I think maybe I planned too many stops there, travelling to a different part of the country every one or two days can be surprisingly tiring, the buses and minivans really aren't much fun. I do actually miss my motorbike! Even though it tried to kill me... I still really want to get one when I get back to the UK though, I can't help it. I don't think you can really put across how much fun it is, and what a great feeling until you've ridden one and experienced it for yourself. An '06 Yamaha R6 will be on the cards eventually though.... watch this (empty parking) space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8031775357/" title="Camera Roll-203 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/8031775357_919abf645b.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-203"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one of my random walks around the city I happened across Buak Hat park, which was a nice little place to sit and gather one's thoughts. Lots of pigeons, it almost felt like I was in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029014602/" title="Chiang Mai-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8169/8029014602_79b2af9fdc.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is one of my favourite photos...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like wandering around a park while I'm in a city. It didn't apply so much to Chiang Mai, which was very relaxed anyway - but it can provide a nice respite from the chaos of daily life. A good place to recharge your battery before heading out to do some more exploring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029076827/" title="Chiang Mai-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8042/8029076827_1246f398f9.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029076712/" title="Chiang Mai-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8318/8029076712_a384b5fe1e.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029116323/" title="Chiang Mai-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/8029116323_5ce7b7dd3f.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/8029117166/" title="Chiang Mai-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8029117166_5b8148a451.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been keeping in touch with Ella, who I'd met briefly in Si Phan Don, Laos. She had already returned to China, but was coming to Bangkok on the 21st September for four days. We wanted to meet up again while she was there, so due to time constraints on my part I planned to head straight down to an island called Koh Tao and get in my precious beach and scuba time before making my way to Bangkok. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1849077619983491488/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/09/chiang-mai.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1849077619983491488'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1849077619983491488'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/09/chiang-mai.html' title='Chiang Mai'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5827253084638695406</id><published>2012-09-02T11:35:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-09-02T11:35:34.910+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Laos'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Luang Namtha'/><title type='text'>Luang Namtha</title><content type='html'>Luang Namtha was my final stop in Laos, and the furthest north I got, at 60km from the Chinese border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bus ride also had a story to tell (unfortunate for me, probably amusing for you). After the last minivan trip, I was pretty sure I didn't want to experience that particular driving style again, they're also devoid of any legroom. I bought a ticket for the big bus which left at 6pm and arrived in Luang Namtha around 3-4am. Not perfect, but I was at least assured it was a big, VIP sleeper bus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bloody wasn't!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7905591428/" title="Camera Roll-208 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/7905591428_87d66eb39c.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-208"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sigh...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also got stuck in a huge traffic jam for an hour at about 1am, I can only assume due to a landslide. The mountain roads were nothing but mud in some parts. This meant we actually arrived in Luang Namtha at about 6am. I hadn't really been able to sleep on the "bus". I'd drifted in and out, resting my head on my trusty inflatable pillow, but sitting bolt upright really doesn't make it easy for me to drift off. I checked in at my guesthouse and immediately went to bed to catch up on some sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke around midday, I headed to Green Discovery again to make some enquiries. There was good and bad news. They had a two day tour, leaving the next day with one person already booked on. Perfect! I put my name and deposit down. The bad news was, the woman that had booked before me informed the sales guy she could only afford it if four people went. So I did the only thing I could do... hunted down and harassed as many random people in the street as I could find! It worked as well... a French couple put their name down too! Weirdly enough, the original woman didn't actually show up again, so it was just me and the French couple, Batiste and Caroline. Fine with me, it still worked out cheaper. As long as they didn't start getting off in front of me... that's just bad taste isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning at 8:30 we met up at the office, bags packed, and were introduced to our guide, Oun. He had actually previously worked out of the Vang Vieng branch, and knew Mang, the guide who took me out when I did the tour there. He'd been in Luang Namtha for three years, working at Green Discovery all that time, so he knew his stuff. Unfortunately one of the many things he knew was the forest we were going to was home to wild cats, bears, spiders, green snakes and king cobras (yes, the ones that can spit venom and will actually chase you if you piss them off) and other things that could potentially kill us. He took great delight in telling us this. Thanks Oun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rode in the van for about one hour outside of town, before turning down a dirt track to reach a stony beach by the side of the Nam Tha river. The kayaks were offloaded from the roof of the van, and we set about packing all of our belongings into dry bags in preparation for the soaking they were likely to receive on the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a kayak with Mr Ling, our temporary second guide. Oun was in a kayak on his own with the majority of the baggage we had, and Batiste and Caroline were in the third. We got off to a great start, which lasted for all of five minutes. Somewhat expectedly (in my opinion), having no prior experience in a kayak, Batiste and Caroline encountered some difficulties at the first set of mild rapids we encountered. Oun was shouting at them to keep left, but they were pulled right by the current, - having not yet gained enough experience with steering - under a low hanging tree branch. This stopped their kayak in its tracks, turning it sideways while still stuck on the branch. The flow of the water under the boat inevitably flipped it over, and they ended up in the water with the contents of their kayak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oun and Mr Ling sprung into action, and the kayak was promptly righted, and Batiste and Caroline hauled inside. Other than looking fairly shocked (and wet, unsurprisingly), they were fine. We carried on, with the Frenchies quickly improving over the next three hours or so. We soon stopped for lunch. Sticky rice, spicy bamboo, green beans and beef, and chicken and pumpkin (I think) laid out on a tablecloth of banana leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899001014/" title="Luang Namtha-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/7899001014_92ae9a3347.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899032068/" title="Luang Namtha-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8172/7899032068_8b11db1060.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899039524/" title="Luang Namtha-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8457/7899039524_3f6a1d1e5a.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having had our fill, we continued our journey down the river for another couple of hours. At one point i saw sonething move extremely quickly out of the corner of my eye, turning round to see something disappear into the bushes. Oun said it was likely to be one of the wild cats they have there, and i was a little disappointed not to have had a proper look. There was also unfortunately another section right near the end where Batiste and Caroline capsized again. I didn't fall in once... that must make me an expert right? Or maybe it means I was in the kayak with one of the guides... anyway, not important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived at the village we were to stay in overnight, and offloaded all our things. At the first sign of our arrival, all the local kids ran down with small platters displaying the goods they had for sale, the majority of which were bracelets. We figured it would be rude not to buy one each, it wasn't expensive for us but would help them out somewhat. So unexpectedly, I now wear a bracelet. Not going to put a pic up of this, if you want to see that badly contact me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were actually in a lodge just outside the village, which is where we ate and slept that night. The following morning we went up to visit it before beginning our trek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899045466/" title="Luang Namtha-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8450/7899045466_c152882ec1.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899010732/" title="Luang Namtha-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8025/7899010732_4b4acc8284.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899015362/" title="Luang Namtha-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8454/7899015362_bf26a9a3ca.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day we were trekking through the forest for five hours. There had been rain during the night, which made some bits very muddy and tricky to navigate, but it was still a great experience. What amazed me was that all three of us "normal" people booked onto the tour were dripping in sweat throughout, but Oun was bone dry. He was wearing a backpack and his back wasn't even sweaty under that. It just goes to show how fit he is and how used to the climate he is. He said he does a tour every weekday (varies between kayaking, trekking, mountain biking or rock climbing), and works in the office at weekends. Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899053424/" title="Luang Namtha-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8182/7899053424_a102ca520f.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899073702/" title="Luang Namtha-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8320/7899073702_f1079aaf58.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899087308/" title="Luang Namtha-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7899087308_9e48c8df0d.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899064206/" title="Luang Namtha-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8031/7899064206_a54234363c.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899025422/" title="Luang Namtha-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7899025422_0fc858939a.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899143836/" title="Luang Namtha-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8438/7899143836_47be8348d0.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899185388/" title="Luang Namtha-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7899185388_21c4b8a47a.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7899415046/" title="Luang Namtha-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7899415046_1f2fba4974.jpg" alt="Luang Namtha-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the tour finished, I relaxed for the rest of the night before heading to bed for a very good night's sleep!

I was in the big, local bus and bumped into them when we stopped halfway for food. They'd opted for the minivan, but due to some sick, twisted turn of fate had ended up with the same driver (micro-sleep man) we'd had going to Phonsavan. Apparently he drives that route too... None of us fancied their chances of making it to Luang Prabang in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular rest stop was easily the most beautiful yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7888452872/" title="Luang Prabang-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8315/7888452872_1e145d6eb4.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7888434504/" title="Luang Prabang-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8035/7888434504_6432646937.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's a well known fact that food is healthier when consumed in that kind of environment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887759846/" title="Luang Prabang-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/7887759846_703de025b4.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On arriving in Luang Prabang, I was tired. I was hungry. But I wasn't worried. I'd done my research. I'd found the best pizza joint in town and boy was I looking forward to that pizza! Thin, crispy base, tasty tomato sauce, delicious melted mozzarella, covered in meat.... I walked along the road once and I couldn't find the place. Odd... But possible that my pizza excitement had caused some temporary blindness. I walked along the road again... still no sign of it. By now my mouth was watering and my stomach was rumbling uncontrollably. I asked staff at one of the restaurants near where it should have been... "Oh yes, that place shut down about two months ago". Nooooooooo! Crushing disappointment. I frantically searched on my phone for an alternative. A restaurant called "The Pizza"?! Promising, I thought. Surely a restaurant actually named after a certain type of food would excel above all others when it comes to cooking it? There would be some kind of moral obligation to their customers to make sure that one thing on their menu was outstandingly amazing wouldn't there?! I couldn't have been more wrong. It was rubbish. I contemplated changing the sign above the door to The Shit Pizza, but I restrained myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luang Prabang is a really nice place to walk around very slowly, and chill at a nearby cafe/smoothie stall when you become exhausted from over-exerting yourself in the process. There are lots of nice tree lined streets, countless wats, and tiny alleyways to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887739190/" title="Luang Prabang-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7887739190_3dae866f24.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887788984/" title="Luang Prabang-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7887788984_4070e8b9bb.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887817154/" title="Luang Prabang-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8306/7887817154_489ee65738.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Monks robes drying in the sun...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887878962/" title="Luang Prabang-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8315/7887878962_aa1e7a30f8.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887919866/" title="Luang Prabang-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7887919866_1712b0a93f.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887838270/" title="Luang Prabang-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/7887838270_3c92f18a8a.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887857832/" title="Luang Prabang-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/7887857832_44bfb44026.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kuang Si Falls is a three tier waterfall about an hours drive outside of Luang Prabang.

My initial reaction was "oooooh, that had to hurt!", followed by laughter at how dumb he was when I saw he was still alive and had his limbs and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887941728/" title="Luang Prabang-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8454/7887941728_4e868b8e2a.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This one actually had half a brain cell...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887959428/" title="Luang Prabang-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7887959428_e8cac81fe7.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7888273746/" title="Luang Prabang-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8299/7888273746_858782f523.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7888292490/" title="Luang Prabang-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7888292490_8d4423254c.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7888353840/" title="Luang Prabang-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8029/7888353840_dc94529a93.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7888416764/" title="Luang Prabang-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8042/7888416764_f00df537ff.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7891849682/" title="Luang Prabang-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8450/7891849682_d4161f5943.jpg" alt="Luang Prabang-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have no idea who these people were, and there's no way I was going to wait for them to bugger off.

The driver was absolutely mental, even by Asian standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly believe he was trying to see just how fast he could throw the van into the corner without it tipping over and sliding off the edge. He was also employing the classic drive-into-the-corner-in-the-middle-of-the-road-then-violently-swerve-back-to-your-own-side-of-the-road-when-you-see-a-huge-oncoming-truck technique. That's my favourite technique by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to a couple of other backpackers sitting up front with him, he also had a micro-sleep at one point, prompting him to drink a couple of cans of Red Bull like cans at the next food stop. Which, coincidentally is where we saw them chopping up a dog in the back. Consequently the only food I ate there was a pot noodle, crisps and biscuits... delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nailbiting hours later, we made it to Phonsavan alive. I immediately set about looking for tours to the Plain of Jars, my reason for travelling to Phonsavan. The Plain of Jars consists of a number of sites containing thousands of large stone jars. No one knows exactly what they were used for, or how old they are. Theories vary from locals believing they were used by a race of giants to brew Lao Lao whiskey in celebration of a great war victory, to the more widely accepted funeral urns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soon found myself having the same problem as I've been encountering previously, there are too few tourists around making it extremely difficult to find tours where people have already booked, thereby reducing the cost. With the choice of paying a ridiculous sum of money to have a "private tour", or hiring a motorbike again for a sixth of the cost, I opted for the bike. I was soon whizzing my way to site 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7830391908/" title="Phonsavan-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7830391908_2df2632edb.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7831899352/" title="Phonsavan-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7831899352_ce6e8c6d49.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7832043996/" title="Phonsavan-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7832043996_835141a3d7.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7834899348/" title="Phonsavan-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7834899348_584ec11262.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887689956/" title="Phonsavan-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/7887689956_1b4788692d.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of many bomb craters in the area caused by US bombs...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7831537330/" title="Phonsavan-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7831537330_ca96cbaa3d.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7831681140/" title="Phonsavan-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8433/7831681140_a60f6f93a7.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7832278358/" title="Phonsavan-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8442/7832278358_c27c320e24.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sign advising you of UXO (unexploded ordinance) is a little disconcerting (Laos is the most heavily bombed country in history, due to the " Secret War" with America, and is still littered with small, round undetonated bombs called "bombies" from cluster bombs), but as long as you stay within the marked areas you're safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887664772/" title="Phonsavan-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8322/7887664772_f32680503a.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7887641668/" title="Phonsavan-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8317/7887641668_9cdccc1164.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bombies are still a huge problem for the Lao people, with over fifty thousand killed or injured since 1964, and the MAG ( Mines Advisory Group) is working tirelessly to detect these bombs, and detonate them safely - as you can see in the photos below. However, even at the current rate of detection, it will be over one hundred years before it is fully safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7832135168/" title="Phonsavan-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7832135168_4fee25caf8.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7854888406/" title="Phonsavan-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8433/7854888406_467dd8f9a6.jpg" alt="Phonsavan-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the guesthouse I stayed in scammed me. I'm pretty sure they asked me to pay one night as I arrived, but then I was charged again as I left. I had no receipt, so I couldn't prove this of course, and to be honest my memory is so bad I may even be imagining things. Note to self: always get a receipt. Another note to self: avoid minivans on mountain roads, which is what I did headed to Luang Prabang, on a nice, slow, local bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2464798215851905810/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/phonsavan.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2464798215851905810'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2464798215851905810'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/phonsavan.html' title='Phonsavan'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7718198020590899824</id><published>2012-08-26T10:53:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-26T10:53:03.720+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Laos'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vang Vieng'/><title type='text'>Vang Vieng</title><content type='html'>No, I didn't go tubing. Shoot me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tubing involves floating down the Nam Song river in a tyre inner tube, grabbing hold of ropes thrown from riverside bars along the way, being pulled in to get suitably pissed, and high, before floating downstream to repeat the process at the next establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what I've come to realise on this trip, is that actually I'm an old, old man who really wouldn't enjoy such shenanigans. Give me a night slowly getting drunk in a bar/pub, with decent music, chatting randomness with mates, over binge drinking till I can't control my actions any day. Oh yeah, no dancing either... dancing is the work of the devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story I heard which perfectly exemplifies the type of person you get going tubing, is one of a nice young lad who got completely wasted at one of the bars. In his merry state, he decided it would be fun to jump into the river from the deck of the bar (plenty of the bars have this kind of setup, some also with rope swings and slides out into the water). One of the bar staff explained to the gentleman that it would be inadvisable to jump into the water, as it was rather shallow in that area and he was likely to do himself some harm. The guy turned round and punched the member of staff, before jumping into the water anyway, only to resurface completely motionless and float off down the river... plenty of people die in similar incidents each year, I heard a number around twenty five last year being mentioned, I don't know how accurate this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set about finding other activities to keep me amused while I was in town. Heading to the local Green Discovery office (these guys run tours throughout Laos, and you'll usually find a branch in one of the places you stop at), I asked if any tours had already been booked by other people, which will always lower the price you pay. They had a one day tour for the next day, which two people had already booked onto, halving the price automatically. Perfect! Sign me up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songthaew arrived at 9am sharp (yeah right!) the next day, and we drove around picking up the rest of the group. More people had obviously booked after me, as we had five people in total, promising a fun day out. Driving around twenty minutes outside town we reached our first stop, Elephant Cave. This cave is a Buddhist temple and has a couple of Buddha statues, as well as a limestone formation resembling an elephant, hence the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7823283810/" title="Vang Vieng-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8438/7823283810_5e9af71bb5.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7823326470/" title="Vang Vieng-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8444/7823326470_aa0093bbbf.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here we walked a short distance to our next stop, Tham Hoi (Snail cave). On the way there we passed a young girl and her mother harvesting crops of peanuts in their field. A few words from our guide, and a handful were passed over for us to try. I can confirm, they tasted like peanuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7823972862/" title="Vang Vieng-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/7823972862_771941579e.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snail cave went much further in, and we were walking for a good twenty minutes, lighting the way with head torches before heading back to the entrance. It was in this one that we saw a snake - apparently the first time the guide had even seen one in there - and a huge spider! Indiana Jones eat your heart out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822550320/" title="Vang Vieng-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8444/7822550320_a48b2cf594.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Than Loup (Deep cave) was next, with stalagtite and stalagmite formations decorating the interior. This wasn't in anywhere near the same league as Kong Lo cave which I'd visited before, but still impressive nonetheless. It wasn't really possible to get photos inside these two caves, as there was no light whatsoever apart from the head torches. On a couple of occasions we would all turn these off and stand in silence, and it was a very surreal experience, not a chink of light or the slightest sound within. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside the cave our guide Mang pointed out a plant that the locals chop up and use in a soup. They drink the soup and if it tastes horrible and mildly burns their mouth and throat, they know they don't have Malaria! However, if the liquid tastes sweet to them, they need to get their arse to a hospital sharpish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822863278/" title="Vang Vieng-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7822863278_433b1ba472.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We trekked to Tham Nam (Water) cave, and were able to experience the infamous Vang Vieng tubing, albeit on a tamer level. At this cave, it was time to strip to our swimwear, float out on a tube and pull ourselves through on a rope affixed to the walls of the cave. This one was easily the most fun! We got to a point in the cave where the water ended and the tubes washed up on a sandy beach. Leaving them behind, we moved further along and the roof of the cave got steadily lower, until we were forced onto our stomachs to wriggle through army style! This part only lasted for around five metres as we emerged into another more spacious section of the cave, and entered the water once again. It felt colder without the tube, as more of your body is submerged. It also slowly rose higher as we moved further in, until Mang said it was not safe to continue due to the fast flowing water we could now hear ahead of us. We returned to the tubes, no longer requiring the rope, as we were carried along at a steady speed back to the cave entrance by the flow of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7824021188/" title="Vang Vieng-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/7824021188_acce24074f.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After emerging from the cave, we sat down to eat lunch before trekking to our next destination, a traditional Hmong village. Naturally though, they had a stall set up to sell snacks to the tourists! I don't tend to like visiting villages like this, as it feels like a big invasion of privacy, so I didn't take any photos here. The villagers are clearly used to it though, and take full advantage where they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We carried on, through stunning scenery, until we met up with the songthaew again and were driven to a point on the river where we could kayak 9km back to town. Sadly I don't have any photos of this activity, for fairly obvious reasons. It's quite wet when you get out on the water. It gets even wetter when you capsize just after coming out of some "rapids" (very tame ones, like you see in the photo). And wetter still when the guide in the other kayak deliberately tips you over for a second time further downstream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822145250/" title="Vang Vieng-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8302/7822145250_660641772b.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Local man chopping bamboo...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7824132632/" title="Vang Vieng-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8301/7824132632_bc776bf043.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Local woman cleaning river weed...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7824184706/" title="Vang Vieng-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7824184706_69b5d55f2a.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822898666/" title="Vang Vieng-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7269/7822898666_5a976210e4.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figs...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822946134/" title="Vang Vieng-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8424/7822946134_a82138bbc3.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wow...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822980612/" title="Vang Vieng-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7822980612_ce796b9e68.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The group, Mang, Me, Evie, Quang, Sophie, Jeremie...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7823238902/" title="Vang Vieng-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7823238902_1b11877295.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7824080512/" title="Vang Vieng-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/7824080512_9e55554fe6.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7824897566/" title="Vang Vieng-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8286/7824897566_1c9119baa3.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7822515160/" title="Vang Vieng-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7822515160_f5f832b10e.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While chatting with two of the people in the group, Quang and Evie, they mentioned they'd booked onto a half day rock climbing tour the following day and that I should come along. I asked what experience they had already, as I have none and I didn't want to be biting off more than I could chew, but they said they were both beginners too. I hadn't yet made any plans, and it sounded like fun so I happily agreed to tag along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7827919706/" title="Vang Vieng-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/7827919706_522fee76ba.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We climbed this...

We had three different sections of the rock-face we would climb, all with varying  levels of difficulty. I think the hardest we did was "6b", I'm sure that'll mean something to someone... It was pretty tough going, and I came off a few times. There's that split second of fear as you feel like you're about to plunge to your death before the rope tightens fully and you swing out and back against the wall. Good fun... All I kept thinking about were those people who climb without ropes and how utterly mental they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7828988214/" title="Vang Vieng-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8428/7828988214_1e373247bf.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7829046230/" title="Vang Vieng-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8434/7829046230_46e4583fc7.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7829709910/" title="Vang Vieng-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8287/7829709910_8d98225cf4.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7829737876/" title="Vang Vieng-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8427/7829737876_299e0b86a2.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7829766658/" title="Vang Vieng-27 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8302/7829766658_138f57a9b5.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-27"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7829805142/" title="Vang Vieng-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/7829805142_6ae806353c.jpg" alt="Vang Vieng-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you spot me?

I wasn't quite sure whether this was true or he was just telling me this to get a fare, but I was at least reassured when I saw locals sitting around in the same spot with bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat down, ordered a pot noodle (it's important to sustain yourself with healthy meals while travelling - there was also no real alternative) and sod's law ensured as soon as my food arrived and I'd eaten one mouthful, the bus showed up. My rucksack was loaded, and me and my pot noodle found an empty seat to finish what we'd started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now it was 7pm, and I had only been waiting for the bus for five minutes, which I was pretty happy about. All I needed now was for the final leg of the journey to magically take five minutes and I'd be laughing. Unfortunately, the bus didn't arrive at Vientiane bus station until 1:30am, and I was pretty exhausted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I arrive somewhere I usually check on google maps on my phone to see how far away I am from the hostel or guesthouse i intend to stay at. If it's only a couple of kilometres I'll walk there, any further and I'll get a tuk tuk or a motorbike. The bus station we got off at was 10km out of town, so I knew I had no chance of walking it. I went through the usual bargaining process with the first driver I saw, getting him down to 20,000 kip (£1.50). I loaded my bag, sat down and waited. And waited. And waited... Another chat with the driver and it became clear he was waiting for other fares from other buses not yet arrived. He wanted around four other people to make it worth his while. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one hour, three other buses and witnessing a local lady carrying a couple of slimy looking, wriggling carrier bags (God only knows what was in there!), I was still the only one sitting in the back of this tuk tuk. I was completely knackered and just wanted a shower and a bed. I moaned at the driver and he said sure we can go now - if you pay 100,000 kip... This wasn't going to happen, so I decided to cut my losses and begin walking the long road into town. I would stop at the first guesthouse I saw for one night and deal with everything the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One kilometre or so further on, a motorbike pulled up offering a ride. I'd been saved! We agreed 30,000 kip to the guesthouse I wanted to stay at, and sped off down the road. I was relieved and happy I was finally going to get some sleep that night! That is, until the guy pulled over by the side of the road exactly 2km (I checked!) away from the guesthouse, demanding an extra 20,000 to take me the rest of the way. "You little blighter", I thought (that's the edited version). No amount or arguing with him about what we agreed initially would move him. I (very) reluctantly paid the thieving bastard and finished the journey on my own two feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having finally made it to the guesthouse I was completely ready for a shower, then bed.....  "We're full, sorry". Bugger. Book in advance, folks. I've been lucky so far in that everywhere I've been has always had room due to it being the off season. Things just had to change tonight, didn't they? He sent me next door, to another guesthouse that luckily I'd also read good things about, and I was blessed to find a free dorm bed available. Shower, bed, sleep.  Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I made it to Vientiane, and what a nice place it is. The capital city of Laos, but not overly busy or hectic. In fact it suits Laos down to the ground as this is the most laid back place I've been to yet. It would be out of place to have a sprawling metropolis here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set about the usual sightseeing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7787029506/" title="Vientiane -13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/7787029506_1b73aac449.jpg" alt="Vientiane -13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patuxai...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7780098284/" title="Vientiane -0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8293/7780098284_f865e4af5a.jpg" alt="Vientiane -0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7787049412/" title="Vientiane -14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7250/7787049412_337cbf36bd.jpg" alt="Vientiane -14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7780114784/" title="Vientiane -1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8443/7780114784_8cc22476f3.jpg" alt="Vientiane -1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7780127554/" title="Vientiane -2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7780127554_3d9b04a264.jpg" alt="Vientiane -2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Royal Palace...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7787008818/" title="Vientiane -12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8434/7787008818_7cca7be8fc.jpg" alt="Vientiane -12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;That dam...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7793636732/" title="Vientiane -0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7793636732_76f07fa3b2.jpg" alt="Vientiane -0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wat Ong Teu...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7793725728/" title="Vientiane -1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7793725728_eb08ba6d95.jpg" alt="Vientiane -1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;That Luang...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814201524/" title="Vientiane -4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7814201524_4f34f0e8d9.jpg" alt="Vientiane -4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814043404/" title="Vientiane -3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7814043404_eda8ee898d.jpg" alt="Vientiane -3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814022450/" title="Vientiane -2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8437/7814022450_93c991d617.jpg" alt="Vientiane -2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7813958868/" title="Vientiane -1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7813958868_e1b9c9271f.jpg" alt="Vientiane -1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tuk tuk driver having a rest...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7813942268/" title="Vientiane -0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img    src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8301/7813942268_6c5bc9de79.jpg" alt="Vientiane -0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite place to go while I was in Vientiane though, was down by the riverfront. It was nice just walking along enjoying the view across to Thailand, watching people jogging, cycling and doing aerobics! Every day they have a massive outdoor session with loudspeakers blasting out songs and instructors at the front for people to follow. It's a great idea and obviously a fantastic way to keep fit, we should try and do something like that in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814220142/" title="Vientiane -5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8299/7814220142_ce21074e44.jpg" alt="Vientiane -5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7787065798/" title="Vientiane -15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8427/7787065798_62ff680306.jpg" alt="Vientiane -15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7780154856/" title="Vientiane -3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7268/7780154856_af695ab2d7.jpg" alt="Vientiane -3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about being down by the Mekong in the afternoon is witnessing the incredible sunsets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7780226760/" title="Vientiane -5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7780226760_720c813299.jpg" alt="Vientiane -5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814314140/" title="Vientiane -2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7814314140_e23eb57b57.jpg" alt="Vientiane -2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814378562/" title="Vientiane -4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7814378562_931c12a9b8.jpg" alt="Vientiane -4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just as picturesque when the sun has all but disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7787139790/" title="Vientiane -16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/7787139790_399acf9085.jpg" alt="Vientiane -16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While staying in the dorm in the guesthouse, I met loads of Japanese people travelling through. Apparently the guesthouse was mentioned in a popular Japanese guidebook, which is why so many visit there. I got to know Yuki, Seiji and Takuma,  and we all went to the food night market together to get some dinner. They were a really nice bunch, and we had breakfast together the next morning with another one of their friends before I left for Phonsavan, and The Plain Of Jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814434460/" title="Vientiane -5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8429/7814434460_4e7871c490.jpg" alt="Vientiane -5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7814482830/" title="Vientiane -6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7132/7814482830_096a8520ba.jpg" alt="Vientiane -6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/5008325755288590951/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/vientiane.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5008325755288590951'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/5008325755288590951'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/vientiane.html' title='Vientiane'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-638341611506652357</id><published>2012-08-17T06:53:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-17T06:53:23.282+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Thakhek'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Kong Lo'/><title type='text'>Thakhek/Kong Lo</title><content type='html'>Getting to Thakhek from Savannakhet was easy. One bus. Getting to Kong Lo from Thakhek was a total pain in the arse, but completely and utterly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure, like me, you often think to yourself "I just wish there was a cave which I could travel through by boat, in complete darkness save for a couple of head torches, for 7 kilometres". Fear not my friends! I've found just the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Thakhek, catch a 7am bus to a random road junction three hours away. Catch a songthaew (a kind of flatbed truck with benches and a roof bolted to the back for carrying passengers) to Ban Nahin, arriving there one hour later. From Nahin, catch another songthaew to Kong Lo, roughy another one hour trip (or at least it should have been). Apparently three days of almost nonstop rain do bad things to the Nahin - Kong Lo road, bad things indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772817860/" title="Kong Lo-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8442/7772817860_0ea5c69212.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772828538/" title="Kong Lo-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8447/7772828538_5b4cacd16f.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was game over for sure, but our driver wasn't going to let a piddly little flood stop him, no Sir. He got out and busily started doing something by the side of the songthaew while we all wandered down to the front of the queue to get a better view. One of the trucks didn't fancy his chances, and tried to perform a three point turn to go back the other way. This didn't work out so well for him when the front of the truck went down the ditch he couldn't see underwater, lifting one of the back wheels off the ground and rendering it impossible for him to reverse back into the road. Everybody piled in to help, adding weight to the back, and pulling against the sides to successfully get him back on the tarmac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772846650/" title="Kong Lo-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8282/7772846650_9cc15b9a61.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We assumed we were next in line to turn around (hopefully less dramatically than the last attempt) when our driver called us all back into the songthaew. Much to our surprise, we were soon driving round the other stopped tractor things and heading straight into the water. Our driver was clearly a mechanical genius (expert bodger) and had done something to somehow let the engine breathe as we drove (sailed) through the water. We made it across the flood and to the other side where there were more vehicles stopped coming the other way, and were soon flying along again towards the cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WGTeKbuIU7E?fs=1" width="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived at the river, and having bought our tickets, boarded a long tail boat to be transported to a small beach by the side of the cave opening. The rough water just outside the cave entrance made it impossible to enter that way. We clambered over roughly carved steps and into the relative darkness of the cave opening. Many boats were waiting in the water, along with outboard motors connected to long propellor shafts. Our boat was prepared, and we boarded once again, ready to make our journey into the unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772895990/" title="Kong Lo-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8296/7772895990_37584c93b6.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772910296/" title="Kong Lo-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8296/7772910296_6aa8132046.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7774530590/" title="Kong Lo-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7774530590_bd5fc8dbac.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772461228/" title="Kong Lo-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7772461228_c8744004ac.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the engine noise echoed off the cave walls, the steady "put put" drowned out the sound of streams of water flowing from the cave roof to the water below. We quickly left daylight behind, and soon the only light to be seen was from the dim head torches we were wearing. At the front of the boat was a spotter, illuminating the way for the 'driver' at the rear. The torches were only just bright enough to see by, and it felt like it would be all to easy to miss one of the cave walls with the light and crash into it, but the boatmen are vastly experienced and know exactly what they're doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling as you glide through the water in the darkness is unlike anything I've experienced before. It really is astonishing, it seems like its never going to end, and you can sense the cave walls all around you despite not being able to see them. The boat was expertly guided on a very specific path, not only to avoid the cave walls, but the large volumes of water falling from the cave roof which would quite easily have soaked us through in a split second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partway through the cave, we stopped once again and carefully stepped onto dry land. The spotter jumped off and led us up some stone steps before flicking a switch to instantly illuminate the area we were now in. A stunning view of stalactites and stalagmites greeted us, with amazing rock formations all around cleverly displayed at their best. This went on, and on, as we walked further along inside the cave, each turn revealing a more impressive formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772505126/" title="Kong Lo-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7772505126_f9a1255087.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772523580/" title="Kong Lo-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7248/7772523580_a73d424dc7.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772581764/" title="Kong Lo-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8442/7772581764_4a960619b9.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772598778/" title="Kong Lo-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8421/7772598778_81c8e909c8.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772611510/" title="Kong Lo-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7772611510_6bc3c391da.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772625386/" title="Kong Lo-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7772625386_2f6c37ac0a.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772749342/" title="Kong Lo-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7772749342_e271c1fb6a.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We reached the end of the path, returning back to the water where our boat was waiting. We continued on for what seemed like forever (in reality it took us just over an hour to get from one end to the other) until eventually we literally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. As we emerged out the other side a spectacular view of lush green mountains, shrouded in mist greeted us. We continued some way ahead, before turning the boat around to return the way we came. We were running against the clock to get back to the songthaew, where the driver was concerned the water level could rise further making it impossible for us to drive back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772776734/" title="Kong Lo-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7260/7772776734_2a2f1945b0.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772788140/" title="Kong Lo-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7772788140_747d4f51a7.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772803680/" title="Kong Lo-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7772803680_46c9107f6b.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7774915364/" title="Kong Lo-24 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8442/7774915364_100c3edbd7.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7778910256/" title="Kong Lo-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8444/7778910256_18838b4990.jpg" alt="Kong Lo-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We safely returned to Nahin, once again navigating the flooded road, and I began the second leg of the journey back to the junction I'd visited earlier that day. I was assured I could get on many buses here from various different places when they stopped for a refreshment break, and continue my journey north to the Laos capital, Vientiane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/638341611506652357/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/thakhekkong-lo.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/638341611506652357'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/638341611506652357'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/thakhekkong-lo.html' title='Thakhek/Kong Lo'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/WGTeKbuIU7E/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-3952960203729599061</id><published>2012-08-15T18:19:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-15T18:19:57.332+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Laos'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Savannakhet'/><title type='text'>Savannakhet</title><content type='html'>Savannakhet turned out to be a bit of a failure all round, but despite that I still enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had intended to go on a guided trek the day after I arrived, to one of the protected areas (national parks) in the vicinity, called Dong Natad. You would learn about the park, the animals, try eating berries and plants etc while making your way to the centre and Nong Lom lake. I'd wanted to do this with a guide as apparently there are lots of paths and I didn't fancy getting myself lost in a forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I arrived I headed straight to the tourist information centre, enquiring about how much it would cost. It worked out to around $60, which is more than I was expecting, and in the end after debating it for a while I decided to save my money. There are apparently far better trekking opportunities in Luang Nam Tha, where I'm heading later. The main problem I'm having with the tours in these places, is they are all very expensive if you want to do them alone. The price decreases if you go in a group, but it can be tricky finding other people who would want to go as well. There were two others who wanted to do the same tour, but they had left the day I arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the trek off the cards, I moved onto my next item on the list. The Dinosaur Museum. This had very good reviews online, and apparently was a good way to spend an hour or so. I headed over there on my rented bicycle, locked it up and walked in, only to be told by a workman that it was closed for renovation. Things weren't working out so well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I contented myself with cycling around the town enjoying the laid back atmosphere. It felt good to be back on a pushbike again, even if it had seen better days. I went for a haircut, picked up some laundry, bought some toothpaste, and generally just did "stuff"! All very boring and mellow, but it was enough for me. The Beer Lao sipped by the Mekong River went down pretty well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7771394348/" title="Savannakhet-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7135/7771394348_43bf4039d9.jpg" alt="Savannakhet-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772432284/" title="Savannakhet-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8141/7772432284_acd5f3aed5.jpg" alt="Savannakhet-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772413316/" title="Savannakhet-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8440/7772413316_9330e0ea60.jpg" alt="Savannakhet-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772048800/" title="Savannakhet-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7278/7772048800_e136c71215.jpg" alt="Savannakhet-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7771985942/" title="Savannakhet-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8282/7771985942_656b1daaff.jpg" alt="Savannakhet-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7771994014/" title="Savannakhet-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/7771994014_e96ae07167.jpg" alt="Savannakhet-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning I jumped on a tuk tuk to the bus station, and continued my journey north, to Thakhek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/3952960203729599061/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/savannakhet.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3952960203729599061'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3952960203729599061'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/savannakhet.html' title='Savannakhet'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-3685211093194225429</id><published>2012-08-13T11:23:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-14T08:20:16.150+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Laos'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Champasak'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pakse'/><title type='text'>Champasak and Pakse</title><content type='html'>Champasak is further north from Si Phan Don, and Pakse further still. I'm combining them as Champasak is basically one short dirt road with some restaurants and guesthouses. Not much in the way of things to do, but then I went there as it was closer to one of the main Laos sights, Wat Phu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wat Phu is another Khmer temple complex, and UNESCO World Heritage Site. After visiting Siem Reap already and towards the end of the three day pass, almost becoming "templed out" as is commonly experienced by others, I initially wasn't sure if I would visit this place. However, it was on my way up north through the country anyway and I also didn't want to miss anything if I could help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived at the site, and immediately knew I'd made the right decision. The location was quite unlike any other temple I'd been to in Siem Reap, in a beautiful location at the base of a mountain. Even if the temple weren't there, it would still have been a worthwhile place to visit. As it was, the temple was pretty much "same same, but different" - a common phrase heard in Southeast Asia! The area was the standout feature in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757439462/" title="Pakse, Laos-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7757439462_3cf76aa1ba.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757956390/" title="Pakse, Laos-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7757956390_f1e747e841.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757973990/" title="Pakse, Laos-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7757973990_241119d553.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758008430/" title="Pakse, Laos-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8302/7758008430_6e1569ac40.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758065398/" title="Pakse, Laos-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8302/7758065398_81cc87d2a2.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm starting to experience a lot more rain lately, I guess that's the inevitable consequence of being here in rainy season! Almost feels like I'm back in London! I always knew that would be the case, it was pretty much impossible for me to be in each place at the perfect time of year. It's only a little bit of water though, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pakse is a much bigger place than Champasak (not hard - it has more than one street). Waterfalls are the order of the day there. The problem is, they are relatively far out of town, the closest one being around 40km away. Every option I explored for getting there worked out ridiculously expensive. This included going on an organised tour to the area - because I would have been the only person doing it. Hiring a tuk tuk for the day also would have been very dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only really left with one option... getting back on my old friend, the motorbike and making my own way there. This was the very last resort, remember I had sold my bike in Cambodia due to not wanting to ride in Asia anymore, so I wasn't too keen on hiring one now, but on my budget I was left with little option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was soon back in the swing of things, even if I was paranoid that every other bike on the road was hell bent on ramming into me. Things went well, up until the turn off the main road to reach the waterfall. I was faced with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757591964/" title="Pakse, Laos-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7757591964_cef81acc65.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757827768/" title="Pakse, Laos-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8437/7757827768_950093a164.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a regular reader, you'll know mud is what broke my bike and nearly stranded me on a mountain in Vietnam. I was determined to beat it this time. Remembering some advice I'd been given from another rider on my travels, I attempted to ride through it with a bit of speed and therefore stay balanced on the bike despite any wobbles it may throw. Big mistake. I hit the very first bit of mud, felt the back of the bike slide sideways, somehow managed to stay on and upright as the bike rode off out of control, coming to a halt on the other side of the road from where I'd started, completely covered in mud from the waist down. Directly in front of me by the side of the road was a small, local restaurant (wooden shack). The owner was stood there smiling in amusement, and I had little option but to join him and laugh at my unfortunate situation! He kindly provided a hose which I used to wash myself and the bike down with, so now it at least looked like I'd only wet myself. I parked the bike up by the side of the road, and walked the further 2km to the waterfall. Fortunately, the view was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757542214/" title="Pakse, Laos-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7757542214_546ff86709.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758185470/" title="Pakse, Laos-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7130/7758185470_18c32d1f80.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758144428/" title="Pakse, Laos-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7758144428_08711b0b9f.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short way up the main road was another, equally impressive waterfall. This one was interesting as you started at the top, with the option of walking down to the bottom if you wanted to. I didn't fancy that bit, as the walkway took you directly into the mountain of spray that was thrown up by the crashing water, and I figured I'd got wet enough for one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757940736/" title="Pakse, Laos-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7126/7757940736_8401835433.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758260394/" title="Pakse, Laos-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7758260394_b9efcaec88.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758291318/" title="Pakse, Laos-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/7758291318_5b3c6bddca.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758328364/" title="Pakse, Laos-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8437/7758328364_dea8a1d86f.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7757914908/" title="Pakse, Laos-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/7757914908_0be30e4019.jpg" alt="Pakse, Laos-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually at this point I would end with a comment about where I was heading to next. On this occasion, however - the journey itself warrants a mention. The local bus I'd boarded to Savannakhet was completely overloaded with vegetables, the kind of overloaded they manage so well here in Asia. The whole back half of the bus was packed from floor to ceiling, and they were also piled high on the roof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were casually pulling out of one of the bus stations we'd stopped at, when we heard a horribly loud scraping of metal. I initially guessed the back of the bus was grinding against a car or bike to the side of us, but further investigation uncovered the root of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772565368/" title="Camera Roll-215 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7772565368_e970634dc7.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driver was forced to continue driving out of the pothole, the sound of metal grinding against the ground was not a pleasant one, and I was sure the engine would be damaged. Luckily it was ok, and apart from being very bent up, we made it all the way to Savvanakhet with no breakdowns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, we also stopped to pick up a herd of pigs. I kid you not. On one of the routine "oh-why-the-hell-are-we-stopping-again" stops, a truck reversed up to the side of the bus, the luggage compartment underneath us was opened, and the pigs were unceremoniously hoisted by their back legs out of the truck, squealing in terror, into the hold. To their credit, once they were in there I almost forgot they were under my feet until I heard the occasional grunt or squeal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7772439676/" title="Camera Roll-218 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8281/7772439676_227ec3548a.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/3685211093194225429/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/champasak-and-pakse.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3685211093194225429'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/3685211093194225429'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/champasak-and-pakse.html' title='Champasak and Pakse'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7203825739785591377</id><published>2012-08-12T08:06:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-12T08:06:53.473+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Laos'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Si Phan Don'/><title type='text'>Don Khon, Si Phan Don (4000 Islands), Laos</title><content type='html'>Oh dear, I ended up in a place basically built for lying in a hammock all day again! I hate when that happens...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Laos. And what a welcome. Sleepy Si Phan Don, otherwise known as 4000 islands is in the south of Laos, pretty much straight after the border from Cambodia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if there are actually 4000 islands or not, I'd be willing to bet that even if someone actually went to the trouble of counting them, they ended up at 3987 or something and rounded up, which is cheating really, but I'll let them off. Regardless, there are far fewer than that in rainy season when I arrived, as the majority of them are underwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two exceptions to this are the islands of Don Khon and Don Det, commonly visited by tourists passing through the area. I opted to stay in Don Khon, which is supposed to be the quieter of the two. The islands are linked by a bridge anyway, so you can easily visit the neighbouring island if you so wish. I had intended to do just that, but my laziness and the hammock on the deck outside my room colluded to ensure that didn't actually happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Khon is serious competition for Otres Beach in Cambodia for the most relaxing place I've been to so far. There are a couple of waterfalls you can visit anytime you want to interrupt your busy 'lying down' schedule - I roused myself long enough to take a walk to one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7684973950/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8151/7684973950_1858aefb37.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683275180/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7683275180_3e993283e5.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683484640/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7683484640_5771d4925d.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683669466/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7683669466_c766bef1f1.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683715920/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8166/7683715920_a3544cc062.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683758946/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8028/7683758946_6de138fdfa.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7684905172/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7684905172_bd269d44d3.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683298398/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8428/7683298398_98720c8354.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7684697832/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7254/7684697832_12f2997f48.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7684810048/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8433/7684810048_e1d32a7bf2.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7684839036/" title="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7259/7684839036_1b19f28587.jpg" alt="Don Khon, Si Phan Don-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deck of the guesthouse gave a great view over the river to Don Det, and downstream to the connecting bridge. There were hammocks outside each of the rooms so people were often relaxing there enjoying the peace and quiet. I met Ella, Emilia and Kevin also staying in the same guesthouse, and we went out for an eventful dinner the one night we were all there together. It started normally enough, but as we began receiving our meals the wind picked up substantially. Before long the inevitable happened and the heavens opened, prompting the restaurant owners to batten down their (largely ineffective) canvas hatches. The wind was blowing the rain in across the restaurant, and we still got fairly wet and cold despite moving the table further away from the edge of the deck! Definitely a meal I'll remember for a while. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, Ella reckoned I look like Hollywood actor Lee Pace, who I'd not actually heard of before - what do you reckon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758365534/" title="Camera Roll-291 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7758365534_97de70481e.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-291"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In typical Asian fashion, Ella broke out the camera the following morning and taught some typical poses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758354556/" title="Dhon Khon-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7257/7758354556_9fdb23319e.jpg" alt="Dhon Khon-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7758353804/" title="Dhon Khon-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/7758353804_1163d3d600.jpg" alt="Dhon Khon-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, being an island you have to arrive and leave by boat. It's quite comical watching people wobbling when getting in and out, the threat of taking a dunk ever present. Luckily I avoided that situation, and made it safely back to dry land to head to Champasak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/7203825739785591377/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/don-khon-si-phan-don-4000-islands-laos.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7203825739785591377'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7203825739785591377'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/don-khon-si-phan-don-4000-islands-laos.html' title='Don Khon, Si Phan Don (4000 Islands), Laos'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5358800046435579190</id><published>2012-08-11T10:21:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-11T10:21:27.259+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Kratie'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cambodia'/><title type='text'>Kratie</title><content type='html'>The main draw of Kratie (krat-chay) is the opportunity to see the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin up close. They live in very specific areas of the Mekong river, and Kratie is one of the places where you can pay for a boat to take you out on the river to catch a glimpse of these rare mammals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to everything I'd read, the best time to see them was early in the day, or late in the afternoon (I assume they head out to the shops to get a few groceries around lunchtime). However, I had it on good authority from the owner of the guesthouse I stayed at that I could safely go around 11 to noon and they'd still make an appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the boat steadily powered it's way out to the middle of the river where the dolphins are known to congregate, I honestly had no idea what to expect. If I'm honest after their first appearance, my initial reaction was one of disappointment. I heard a 'whoosh' of air behind me, quickly turning around to briefly see a shape disappear beneath the water around fifty metres away. We repeated this process a few times, with me starting to wonder if this would be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why were they not jumping around like lunatics, splashing me with their flippers and balancing balls on their noses like "normal" dolphins? I knew I should have packed a beach ball and a hoop...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time went on though, thanks to the efforts of the boatman slowly manoeuvring us with the oars, the dolphins gradually grew closer and closer, to the point where they were only a few metres away from the boat. Seeing them up close like this was pretty special, and I soon forgave them for being flat out lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking photos of these guys was nigh on impossible. There was absolutely no way of knowing where they would pop up next. The best chance you had was focusing the camera where they last surfaced and hoping they came up there again. I'm just glad I have a digital camera, not film, as I ended up with countless shots of plain, boring water as I was too slow to catch the buggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest encounters came just as we were about to head back to dry land. A few metres away from the boat, the dolphins would do their usual trick of blowing some air, then resubmerging, but thanks to some Dr. Doolittle style copycat "whoosh" noises by the boatman, they seemed to hang around at the surface for a little longer. This continued for ten more minutes or so, with me half expecting this guy to don a rubber dolphin suit and jump in with them. He didn't, much to my disappointment, but it was still really enjoyable all the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683204462/" title="Kratie-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8003/7683204462_de9434b8a0.jpg" alt="Kratie-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683209434/" title="Kratie-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7683209434_c0f4780827.jpg" alt="Kratie-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683216404/" title="Kratie-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/7683216404_0339431590.jpg" alt="Kratie-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683226222/" title="Kratie-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8168/7683226222_099a35ed02.jpg" alt="Kratie-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683233778/" title="Kratie-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7263/7683233778_7f83fb6946.jpg" alt="Kratie-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7683240230/" title="Kratie-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7683240230_c27088da66.jpg" alt="Kratie-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kratie was my last stop in Cambodia, before heading up to Si Phan Don (4000 Islands) in Laos.

If you need a temple fix, Siem Reap is the place for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually saw very little of Siem Reap itself, I spent that long visiting the temples each day. A three day entry ticket to the Angkor complex costs $40, and then you hire a tuk tuk for those days, to drive you round to each site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temples really are incredible, I couldn't quite get my head around just how huge and complex they were. Angkor Wat is the most famous by far, and gets inundated with tourists (especially at sunrise) each day, hoping for that killer shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7643549434/" title="Siem Reap-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7643549434_c797a7fc57.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7648172780/" title="Siem Reap-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7648172780_8bf062bf67.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7648164482/" title="Siem Reap-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7266/7648164482_1de4647477.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just a few other people...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7646158292/" title="Siem Reap-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7646158292_7da678e652.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7646104260/" title="Siem Reap-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7646104260_d0b2132653.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7646215114/" title="Siem Reap-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8019/7646215114_2c2048199c.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7646258318/" title="Siem Reap-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/7646258318_efcea967c3.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7650289396/" title="Siem Reap-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7650289396_33e9284380.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7650321958/" title="Siem Reap-35 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7274/7650321958_b8624bd84a.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-35"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7650341510/" title="Siem Reap-36 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/7650341510_83d191ddd8.jpg" alt="Siem Reap-36"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite by far, however, was Beng Mealea. This particular temple has been completely overrun by nature, I felt like Lara Croft (Tomb Raider) exploring that place, just with smaller breasts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the other temples you could visit, at Beng Mealea you were granted free reign to climb over all of the ruins and explore other hidden areas that you would not otherwise have seen. Few people deviate from the path like this, so you do have the sensation that you are there alone discovering the crumbling ruins for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a

often found myself at a loss for words at the shear scale of some of them.

As I predicted, for me it couldn't quite top The Dark Knight - Heath Ledger's 'Joker' saw to that - but it was a fantastic film, and a worthy ending to the trilogy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onwards and upwards to my final stop in Cambodia, Kratie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/8190242344453560822/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/siem-reap.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/8190242344453560822'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/8190242344453560822'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/08/siem-reap.html' title='Siem Reap'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-8022244321158228844</id><published>2012-07-31T10:10:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:29:54.761+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Battambang'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cambodia'/><title type='text'>Battambang</title><content type='html'>Health and safety freaks need not apply. Or, just avoid the bamboo train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locals have taken it upon themselves to build 'trains' out of bamboo, which they run on disused railway lines. The trains consist of a small bamboo platform plonked ontop of two sets of wheels, powered by a motorbike engine. The rails have seen far better days, so you're in for a bumpy, noisy unsafe, uncomfortable ride... but great fun all the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a single line track, so if you meet another train coming towards you, the train with the lighter load is dismantled and reassembled once the other has passed. It turned out to be a smart move loading the moto and driver I'd hired for the day onto the train then, as apparently they always take precedence and the other train needs to be taken apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7643512984/" title="Battambang-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7139/7643512984_836ff9a95e.jpg" alt="Battambang-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7643795360/" title="Battambang-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/7643795360_fb6522261b.jpg" alt="Battambang-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perfectly straight tracks...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7643606824/" title="Battambang-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8150/7643606824_68702ba38f.jpg" alt="Battambang-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7643668184/" title="Battambang-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/7643668184_99e9ba6ce8.jpg" alt="Battambang-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had forced about three other trains off the track before we reached the end of the line. My arse was pretty sore by that point so I was glad to arrive. I'm definitely planning on building my own bamboo train when I get back to London though, it would certainly save me money on train fares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the future of the bamboo train looks bleak. There are plans to establish proper rail connections between the major cities in Cambodia, which would use the existing track and force the bamboo trains to stop operating. It can only be a good thing to have that kind of new development, but it's still a shame something so quaint has to be sacrificed as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the bone shaking experience on the bamboo train, came the more sedate temple exploration of Ek Phnom, and Phnom Banan. I'd read that these were the poor relations of the Angkor temples in Siem Reap (where I was headed next), but were still worth checking out. I found them impressive to say the least, so I was really looking forward to what Siem Reap had to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7645918198/" title="Battambang-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8427/7645918198_c77911329d.jpg" alt="Battambang-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7645978790/" title="Battambang-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7645978790_364d1a6758.jpg" alt="Battambang-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7646037502/" title="Battambang-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7251/7646037502_6d36211877.jpg" alt="Battambang-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn't an awful lot else to do in Battambang, and having spent longer than I'd intended to in Sihanoukville already, I pressed on to Siem Reap to try and make up some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/8022244321158228844/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/battambang.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/8022244321158228844'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/8022244321158228844'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/battambang.html' title='Battambang'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7491646037599455881</id><published>2012-07-26T07:52:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:29:32.009+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sihanoukville'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Otres Beach'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cambodia'/><title type='text'>Otres Beach, Sihanoukville</title><content type='html'>As far as they go, this one scores highly on my beachometer. Clean white sand, palm trees, clean water, quiet... I had only intended to stay for a few days, I ended up spending a week here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I'd spoken to so far who had travelled to Sihanoukville while in Cambodia, recommended Otres Beach. With such high ratings, I headed straight here when I reached Sihanoukville, and didn't regret my decision in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other beaches in the vicinity, Serendipity, Ochheuteal, Independence, Sokha, but Otres has the reputation as being the quietest and nicest. After visiting the others (briefly, admittedly) I'd definitely agree. There's a higher class of people here. It explains why I fit in so comfortably to be honest... (ahem!). Plus at night Serendipity has ladyboys at the bars. Ladyboys! My first encounter with them. Merely spotting them in the bars and nothing more before anybody gets any ideas... I didn't think I'd need to worry about this until Thailand, but apparently 'snook' has a thriving ladyboy population also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd planned to sell my bike in Sihanoukville so I asked around at some bars along the beach to see if anyone was interested. I was offered $150 by the owner of one of the restaurants there, which wasn't bad but I was pretty sure I could get more for it if I went to the trouble of printing out for sale posters, riding into the main town and sticking them up on the walls of bars and hostels. The decision should have been a no-brainer, but by this time i'd already found my way back to a sun lounger on the beach and Otres Beach easily magnifies my laziness. It was very hard indeed to force myself to get up to go to the toilet, let alone make the trip into town to walk around posting up flyers. Common sense prevailed however, and I knew I had to do it if I wanted some extra dollar (which I did!). The effort paid off, and I managed to get $225 for it, which I was very happy with. I was sad to say goodbye to my beautiful 'Win', but the time had come for us to part ways and start seeing other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did very little else with my time in Sihanoukville, other than relaxing on the beach and swimming. I probably could have found plenty to do, had I wanted to... but Otres is the kind of place where you feel entirely comfortable with doing very little. Besides, after my accident I figured I deserved some rest, before heading back to Phnom Penh to collect the camera battery and charger I left in the wall socket of the hostel I stayed in (oops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7589921478/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7589921478_2a1c2ced76.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602981598/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8287/7602981598_ea917ab033.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7603435820/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7603435820_56c3f93134.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7603012388/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7603012388_c567d69fbb.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602944542/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/7602944542_78ff751c59.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602906366/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8427/7602906366_9f33e881dd.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7603170550/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7265/7603170550_f22a7b7f77.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7603208554/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8011/7603208554_ac9bd0989b.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7603353924/" title="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8010/7603353924_ef071b647d.jpg" alt="Sihanoukville, Otres Beach-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/7491646037599455881/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/otres-beach-sihanoukville.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7491646037599455881'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/7491646037599455881'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/otres-beach-sihanoukville.html' title='Otres Beach, Sihanoukville'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2405939164418291766</id><published>2012-07-19T13:32:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:29:10.617+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Kampot'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cambodia'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Kep'/><title type='text'>Kep, Kampot &amp; The Big Motorcycle Crash</title><content type='html'>Kep is famous for its crab. Which would have been great, had I actually enjoyed the crab I tried there. I've never had to work so hard for a meal in all my life. It would be perfect diet food, as I'm certain you expend more calories actually going through the ordeal of eating your meal than you consume. I didn't even think it tasted all that great. Sure, it was nice, but not fantastic. The little bits of shell in my mouth didn't help matters. I can safely say I'm over crab. The view in Kimly restaurant was amazing though, and it's built over the water so you hear the waves crashing underneath you. Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7549152036/" title="Kep-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/7549152036_5762d5ff88.jpg" alt="Kep-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7549977962/" title="Kep-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/7549977962_193ee15ff9.jpg" alt="Kep-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to splurge with my accommodation in Kep, settling on a whopping $16 (£10) a night tree top bungalow with a view across the Gulf of Thailand, at the aptly named Tree Top Bungalows resort. To give you some idea of prices in general here, they also had a slightly smaller bungalow with a shared bathroom for $5 (£3) per night.

The attraction of the area is Bokor mountain, where there is a brand new hotel/casino complex. There are also plans afoot to develop the whole of the area to include new housing and more hotels. Frankly in my opinion it looks like an eyesore, but decide for yourself. There is also an old abandoned hotel and church which I'd heard about, which I was really interested in. I love exploring old buildings, back in England I'd previously wandered round an old mental asylum with some friends, generally getting spooked out and taking cool photos. Good times. Unfortunately I'd arrived a little too late, and the old hotel was already being restored by workers back to its former glory. It still looked pretty eerie when the mist rolled in though. I was more fortunate with the church, and got a few nice photos inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7590049044/" title="Kampot-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7590049044_4ea77e11ac.jpg" alt="Kampot-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7601828194/" title="Kampot-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7601828194_fc6998ed24.jpg" alt="Kampot-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7590165538/" title="Kampot-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/7590165538_356f0d6409.jpg" alt="Kampot-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602021362/" title="Kampot-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8425/7602021362_8ccf9bd1a3.jpg" alt="Kampot-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7601800040/" title="Kampot-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7119/7601800040_75590d6e3e.jpg" alt="Kampot-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7590579126/" title="Kampot-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7590579126_c7acc703c5.jpg" alt="Kampot-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7590330562/" title="Kampot-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7261/7590330562_eb172104e0.jpg" alt="Kampot-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7589984708/" title="Kampot-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7261/7589984708_de12259924.jpg" alt="Kampot-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602598850/" title="Kampot-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/7602598850_c624c91eea.jpg" alt="Kampot-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602792108/" title="Kampot-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7602792108_9e85dc29e2.jpg" alt="Kampot-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602825898/" title="Kampot-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7602825898_b95d7ba2a8.jpg" alt="Kampot-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7602861432/" title="Kampot-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7602861432_7306352f4b.jpg" alt="Kampot-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the atmosphere of Kampot for nearly one day before things became very stressful and painful, extremely quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the fantastic, joyous time I'd been having riding my beloved Honda Win around the place? It suddenly decided to turn on me in a vicious, unprovoked attack. Well technically, my Win didn't turn on me, the motorbike that crashed into me turned on me and decided I'd had enough fun for a while. The other guy hit the side of me as I was turning into a side road across his path, but it was clear from the damage to the front end of his bike that he was travelling at quite some speed, at night. Both of us ended up sprawled on the road, thankfully only with scrapes and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7603051718/" title="Kampot-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7603051718_a80593a1ec.jpg" alt="Kampot-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He immediately demanded $200 for the damage to his bike, and I naively agreed, having read online it's best to just pay out and avoid getting the police involved. His friends turned up, took us to the nearest ATM, only for me to discover my wallet had somehow got bent up in the crash, including my credit card held within. I tried straightening it up somewhat, fearful of snapping it, then fed it to the machine which predictably swallowed it and never spat it out again. Shit. I explained the situation to my new pals, they seemed pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expecting that I would do a runner without paying up (hard when my motorbike was unrideable), they wanted to know where I was staying. We all happily rode off to my hostel (ironically named Blissful), where I was quite literally saved by Ez, the owner. He told them in no uncertain terms, they were not getting a penny out of me that night and we would bring both bikes down to the hostel and inspect them there with the tourist police. I wasn't too sure about that bit, but frankly, the guy's been there eight years so he knows his stuff, and I was in no fit state to argue even if I'd been inclined to. I actually later found out, if you're the ones who call the tourist police, they're almost on your side anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My buddies wandered out of the bar, and Ez sat me down and poured me a large scotch. I don't usually drink this but I definitely wasn't going to decline on this occasion. After virtually downing it I went back to the scene of the accident and started walking my bike back to the hostel, as it was unrideable due to a broken clutch lever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned, I found the police (of the tourist variety, to be honest I still don't understand the distinction) had been called in by Ez, and the group of Khmer guys were back. Much arguing/negotiation ensued, translated by staff at the hostel and mediated by the police. It was eventually agreed the damage to the bike(s) would be repaired, and I would pay the bill. The alternative would have been the police getting further involved, taking the bikes into the police compound, determining liability etc, which was a whole heap of hassle I didn't want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning we got the bikes to the mechanic and had them checked over. The other guys bike would cost $175, mine would cost $75. This would have been fine, had I actually been able to withdraw any money. If you've been reading regularly you may remember I lost my debit card in Hanoi. My second card was now trashed. I had a third emergency card, which also would have been great, if I could remember the pin number for it. I really don't make things easy for myself sometimes. A Skype call to super mum back home, giving her a near heart attack before a day at work, saw £400 rescue money winging it's way to me via Western Union. With the money situation temporarily sorted, the bikes were repaired, the garage was paid, and everybody lived happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except I didn't particularly want to get on the bike again. I know that's technically the first thing you should do, but I'd known it was dangerous enough in the first place when I bought the bike, and I figured my luck had run out. I planned to ride the bike a short 100km to my next location, Sihanoukville, where I would attempt to sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2405939164418291766/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/kep-kampot-big-motorcycle-crash.html#comment-form' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2405939164418291766'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2405939164418291766'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/kep-kampot-big-motorcycle-crash.html' title='Kep, Kampot &amp;amp; The Big Motorcycle Crash'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1813552701665455264</id><published>2012-07-11T17:28:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:28:46.771+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Phnom Penh'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cambodia'/><title type='text'>Phnom Penh, Cambodia</title><content type='html'>The ride from Ho Chi Min City to Phnom Penh was an interesting one. From the outset I wasn't even sure when I made it to the Cambodian border if I'd be allowed to cross with my motorbike. I'd read conflicting reports online, some people had no problems, others were refused. I wanted to try it anyway, and if I was turned away I could just return to Ho Chi Minh, sell the bike and jump on a bus to take me there instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be extremely easy. I parked the bike up, walked inside and asked a border official (who, by the way, appear to be the most miserable people in the world) who told me to line up like everybody else, then wheel my bike through when I'm done. Erm, ok! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After literally walking through the border, I had only gone a few kilometres when it started raining. Heavily. This continued until I arrived in Phnom Penh, for around four hours. I was pretty depressed by the time I arrived, so checked into the first reasonably priced hotel I found, and headed straight out to the best rated pizza place I found on Trip Advisor! Pizza has become my comfort food on this trip. It's the one western dish I keep coming back to in the various places I've been visiting. Sometimes you just need a taste of home! (England, not Italy). Of course you always need to try the local cuisine, the first Khmer dish I went for was Amok. This is a mild, creamy curry with fish or chicken. It was delicious. I still cannot bring myself to get my camera out and take a photo of my food before I eat it though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Phnom Penh, there were two places I really wanted to visit, despite how unpleasant I knew they would be. Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S21/Security Centre 21) and Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S21 used to be a school but was converted into a prison, and place of torture during the Khmer Rouge era. From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, lead by Pol Pot massacred over three million Cambodians. S21 was just one of many such places set up throughout the country. Words can hardly describe the feeling you experience when you set foot inside this place. The walls are surrounded with two layers of razor wire, and there are fourteen graves next to a wooden gallows in the courtyard. These are the graves of prisoners who were abandoned by the Khmer Rouge, discovered by the Vietnamese army when they invaded the country to stop the genocide. The odd thing is, if you ignore the fact there are graves and a gallows in the courtyard, you can still imagine what it must have been like when it was used as a school. Full of children running and playing, laughing with their friends. It's really quite chilling when you then think of what it became.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500523984/" title="Phnom Penh-90 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7248/7500523984_ba8257b229.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500356018/" title="Phnom Penh-60 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7500356018_e59ce6025e.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-60"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500513620/" title="Phnom Penh-88 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8001/7500513620_5ddf8281c6.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-88"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500378048/" title="Phnom Penh-64 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8158/7500378048_894aa817cc.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-64"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500381272/" title="Phnom Penh-65 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7500381272_61bea06874.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-65"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500372952/" title="Phnom Penh-63 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8008/7500372952_6d54f1155e.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-63"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500498730/" title="Phnom Penh-85 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7500498730_0141774f98.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-85"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500492798/" title="Phnom Penh-84 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8421/7500492798_c373a21484.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-84"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500508814/" title="Phnom Penh-87 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8432/7500508814_af97ee6eb8.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500488870/" title="Phnom Penh-83 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7260/7500488870_af33d41d6a.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-83"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500461398/" title="Phnom Penh-78 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/7500461398_996b8a785c.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-78"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500466152/" title="Phnom Penh-79 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7500466152_9f892b1fc4.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-79"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500360708/" title="Phnom Penh-61 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7500360708_c29254eff7.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-61"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500413160/" title="Phnom Penh-68 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7250/7500413160_bf216e2c7b.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-68"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While countless Khmer people died at S21, it would not have been 'efficient' for the Khmer Rouge to execute masses of people here. After torturing them until they could bare the pain no longer, the victims were forced to confess to ridiculous crimes they did not commit, sentenced to death, and transported in groups to Choeung Ek - an old Chinese graveyard a short distance outside the city. Here the Khmer Rouge would unload the prisoners, and execute them next to mass graves. The bodies have since been exhumed, and the bones now lie in a monument at the site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodies that were found have been removed, but as you walk around the edge of the mass graves, on the 'paths' you can still see garments, fragments of bone and even whole teeth as they are gradually uncovered by rainfall. If that weren't horrific enough, possibly the worst part for me was standing by 'The Killing Tree'. Bullets were expensive for the Khmer Rouge, so they would use alternative methods to execute people. Infants would be held by their legs and swung against the tree, then added to the mass grave with their mothers. You can't quite comprehend the evil that would be required to carry out such an act, and I was very overwhelmed not just at that particular location, but in the whole place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500417814/" title="Phnom Penh-69 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/7500417814_1032b98120.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-69"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500438606/" title="Phnom Penh-73 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7258/7500438606_003812cf0f.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-73"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500433140/" title="Phnom Penh-72 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7500433140_c844f40a8c.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-72"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500529634/" title="Phnom Penh-91 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7500529634_9f556e1ddf.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-91"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500536144/" title="Phnom Penh-71 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8025/7500536144_e20c7c6ee9.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-71"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to this only being thirty odd years ago, people are still hugely affected today. With over three million people killed, that was every one in four of the population. Every local you meet here in Cambodia has members of their family who suffered. It also strikes you walking around, just how few old people there are in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a (much) lighter note, which i definitely needed after visiting those two places in one day, the following day I booked a tour to Phnom Tamao Wildlife Sanctuary. This place is commonly mistaken as a zoo, but does in fact take in unwanted and mistreated animals before attempting to release them into the wild if at all possible. I had a really great time here, made all the more enjoyable by the lovely tour guide Vathana. She's been doing the tour for years, and the people at the sanctuary are just like family, so she's allowed into all the backstage areas. We got to go into the tiger house for example, which was an unexpected treat. We also got to go round the back of the leopard enclosure, and have some very thin looking chainlink fence seperating us from them. I think this was my favourite animal overall. Vathana's favourite there is Lucky, the elephant. She's very intimidating at first, due to the sheer size of her! But you soon get used to that. Feeding her is a very slimy job though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7499385348/" title="Phnom Penh-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr"

have dinner (and amazing homemade banana milkshakes!) with her and her husband. On arriving, she entered the kitchen, refusing any assistance from us (apparently we would have just slowed her down!), and emerged later with an amazing homemade feast! Vathana's kindness is indicative of the experience I've had with all Khmer people since I've been here. But then I also thought that of Vietnamese people. I've since spoken to other travellers who have said Vietnamese people weren't that friendly, that certainly wasn't my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last place I visited before I left was the Royal Palace and the silver pagoda. The latter so named due to having a floor covered in silver. However, they cover most of it up with carpet and the bits that aren't covered cant be photographed anyway! Ah well, the buildings look nice outside...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7549129700/" title="Phnom Penh-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7549129700_36b0d64412.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7549123600/" title="Phnom Penh-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/7549123600_ba978747bc.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7549101050/" title="Phnom Penh-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7549101050_83c99b89c5.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1813552701665455264/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/phnom-penh-cambodia.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1813552701665455264'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1813552701665455264'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/phnom-penh-cambodia.html' title='Phnom Penh, Cambodia'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-4433161157024959644</id><published>2012-07-04T13:14:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:28:17.071+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vietnam'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Saion'/><title type='text'>Ho Chi Minh City</title><content type='html'>After the journey I'd been on to get here, Ho Chi Minh City certainly had a lot to live up to. I'm delighted to say it didn't disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is how much bigger and more modern everything is compared to Hanoi. Staying in the old quarter there, everything feels almost claustrophobic as street vendors, motos, taxis, buses and pedestrians all jostle for position. Don't get me wrong, I like this as it's part of what makes Hanoi feel unique, but I think I like Ho Chi Minh better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it's my familiarity with London which is swaying me in that direction. In my opinion there is a stronger sense of being in a big city when wandering the streets of hcm, compared to Hanoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you measure a city by it's skyline, hcm isn't doing too badly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500556612/" title="Ho Chi Minh City-67 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8003/7500556612_c2429962bf.jpg" alt="Ho Chi Minh City-67"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were plenty of tours available via the hostel and the various travel agents in the backpacker area, as per usual. Two that I wanted to go on were the Cu Chi Tunnels tour, and the Mekong Delta tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cu Chi tunnels are a network of underground tunnels that were used by Viet Cong guerrillas during the war. They inexplicably used to live down there. I still have no idea how they could possibly do it, I was uncomfortable enough as it was and the tunnels have since been made wider and taller for tourists to move through! Here I am:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500572164/" title="Camera Roll-320 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7500572164_41bae53fdc.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so that's not really me. I did go through the tunnel but I had no one to take a photo of me. Choose to believe me or not - I won't hold it against you if you don't! You can see from that random internet picture just how tight it is though. Not the most comfortable of places to be, that's for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They showed the booby traps that the guerrillas would set to injure and kill enemy troops. This isn't somewhere you wanted to end up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458467256/" title="Saigon-37 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7458467256_f20c90f122.jpg" alt="Saigon-37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458474566/" title="Saigon-38 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/7458474566_82ec02ba8d.jpg" alt="Saigon-38"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the guerrillas have to crawl around in the ridiculously cramped tunnels, they didn't exactly make it easy for themselves to get into them in the first place either. This hatch shows the size of a typical entrance, which would then be covered with leaves and dirt to conceal it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430377410/" title="Saigon-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/7430377410_39ca9d9322.jpg" alt="Saigon-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above photo shows our tour guide, Hai. Hai was quite a character. He was explaining to us how the Viet Cong guerrillas living underground during the war were not only male, but female also. He went on to explain how the majority of these women were virgins, as was the lady who worked in the coffee shop (whom he obviously knows on a fairly intimate level). As if this information wasn't enough, we were asked the question... "You know what virgin means?". You could sense the discomfort in the air. Some people nodded uneasily, collectively we were willing him to stop talking. "Virgin means she not yet married, and doesn't know how big the banana is!". Thanks Hai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mekong Delta tour took us an hour and a half outside of the city, to Turtle Island. We were first able to try some honey directly from a beehive, before drinking tea with royal jelly added. I don't usually drink tea, but this was actually pretty tasty. Then again I do have a sweet tooth. You could of course purchase the royal jelly for a small fee. We were also presented with a selection of exotic fruit, including the smallest banana I have ever seen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430390684/" title="Saigon-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7275/7430390684_71c6426e1b.jpg" alt="Saigon-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430384732/" title="Saigon-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7430384732_22fda602c8.jpg"  alt="Saigon-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458509020/" title="Saigon-42 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7458509020_b54c198929.jpg" alt="Saigon-42"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all this was being consumed, we were treated to some traditional Vietnamese folk music. If I'm honest, I didn't enjoy it that much. At the risk of sounding like an old lady talking about heavy metal - it just sounded like noise. The singing was very unusual. Maybe if I'd have been able to understand the language I would have appreciated it more. But maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trip in a rowing boat was our next activity. This was very peaceful, and was a really enjoyable way of travelling down one of the tributaries of the river, but unfortunately it was over a little too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430776702/" title="Saigon-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8001/7430776702_e385ff19c2.jpg" alt="Saigon-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430797196/" title="Saigon-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/7430797196_19f58f0d62.jpg" alt="Saigon-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430791050/" title="Saigon-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/7430791050_f5c3f044cc.jpg" alt="Saigon-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430783696/" title="Saigon-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7430783696_f07785b04f.jpg" alt="Saigon-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area we were dropped off at had people making coconut candy sweets. Grinding up coconut produces coconut powder, which is then pressed in a vice to produce coconut juice. This, plus malt and sugar is cooked together for forty five minutes, when it takes on a 'gloopy' consistency. As it cools it becomes harder, so it is pressed into moulds to produce long strands, then chopped into smaller, sweet sized pieces. These smaller, sweet sized pieces are little cubes of joy. They taste so good I bought three packs of them, one with added chocolate, one with nuts and one plain. Chocolate is the best, just because, well, it's chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7432411600/" title="Saigon-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5275/7432411600_df24691843.jpg" alt="Saigon-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7432435990/" title="Saigon-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7432435990_93b57574fa.jpg" alt="Saigon-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7432481042/" title="Saigon-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8147/7432481042_6c50dce808.jpg" alt="Saigon-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7432371296/" title="Saigon-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5155/7432371296_7d535851fb.jpg" alt="Saigon-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430808426/" title="Saigon-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5115/7430808426_1f901b9a85.jpg" alt="Saigon-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our trip to the free lunch was on a bigger boat with an engine, which took us on the huge Mekong River itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458355282/" title="Saigon-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/7458355282_6e8f5bb93f.jpg" alt="Saigon-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458367394/" title="Saigon-27 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7458367394_4bf7a2fe19.jpg" alt="Saigon-27"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a moany Canadian woman on our table at lunch, because apparently we were supposed to get some fancy fish to eat, instead of the fried rice we did get. I don't know, just be quiet, eat and be happy woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before returning to the city, we visited a pagoda that I didn't catch the name of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458384524/" title="Saigon-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7458384524_0e61f43e7a.jpg" alt="Saigon-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458448108/" title="Saigon-31 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7112/7458448108_a3124f2b87.jpg" alt="Saigon-31"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458515842/" title="Saigon-43 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7247/7458515842_e867dc048d.jpg" alt="Saigon-43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458536056/" title="Saigon-46 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/7458536056_38b1787dea.jpg" alt="Saigon-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tours were definitely worth doing. They are very popular, which does mean you end up plodding along in a big group of people, but with the added benefit of a tour guide they do have their benefits. Also for something like the Mekong Delta tour, I think you'd find it difficult and expensive to arrange each individual element yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The War Remnants Museum is a very worthwhile place to visit while you're here. It pulls no punches in delivering the cold, hard realities of war and some of the photos in the exhibits there make for difficult viewing. It is obviously very biased against America, but definitely a must see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458492620/" title="Saigon-40 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7280/7458492620_7b405bb58f.jpg" alt="Saigon-40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458482672/" title="Saigon-39 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/7458482672_4c20e3e466.jpg" alt="Saigon-39"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458500486/" title="Saigon-41 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7127/7458500486_5206f7f173.jpg" alt="Saigon-41"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reunification Palace didn't impress me too much, other than the architecture of the building itself which was of course very impressive. However, I didn't find the inside all that engaging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458428430/" title="Saigon-33 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7458428430_9ba05c5897.jpg" alt="Saigon-33"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458442218/" title="Saigon-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8157/7458442218_6ac110daae.jpg" alt="Saigon-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458545618/" title="Saigon-47 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8023/7458545618_655ecddc23.jpg" alt="Saigon-47"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458527926/" title="Saigon-45 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8008/7458527926_f926314eeb.jpg" alt="Saigon-45"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the outskirts of the city lies Binh Quoi park. This place is a real change of scene to what you encounter every day on the busy streets, and is a great way to relax and chill out for a bit. In the evening they also do an amazing outdoor buffet dinner with a huge number of dishes available. You just wander from bamboo shack to shack sampling the delicious food they're cooking up. It's fair to say I quite enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458552940/" title="Saigon-48 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8165/7458552940_1ab6260a78.jpg" alt="Saigon-48"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458560974/" title="Saigon-49 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7274/7458560974_0f72936a36.jpg" alt="Saigon-49"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458569660/" title="Saigon-50 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/7458569660_cce6d6a3be.jpg" alt="Saigon-50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458583208/" title="Saigon-51 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7107/7458583208_784d9e79d4.jpg" alt="Saigon-51"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458595692/" title="Saigon-52 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8013/7458595692_2bca2f844a.jpg" alt="Saigon-52"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458604536/" title="Saigon-53 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7249/7458604536_1b8c01ba0a.jpg" alt="Saigon-53"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458670854/" title="Saigon-54 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7458670854_c88089dab4.jpg" alt="Saigon-54"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7458453438/" title="Saigon-35 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7458453438_d219f29c96.jpg" alt="Saigon-35"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the subject of food... this little gem would have been more suited to the Hanoi to Saigon post but I forgot about it, and I want to include it here somewhere so I remember it in future (although it is hard to forget). At the various stops along the way during our epic ride, the most common food you encounter is pho, which is a noodle soup with either chicken (ga)  or beef (bo). However, on one terrifying stop we were served the most disgusting looking boiled eggs you have ever seen. They appeared to be covered in veins and looked malformed and misshapen. It was something I imagine an alien egg to look like if it were boiled up and served on a plate. Needless to say, we didn't eat them. I've looked online since, and I think they were duck embryo eggs. This image certainly looks very similar to what we had in our bowls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7500572512/" title="Camera Roll-321 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8159/7500572512_d84cb0a72d.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-321"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest beach to Ho Chi Minh is at Vung Tau, around one hundred and twenty kilometres away. This is the place the city dwellers head to on the weekend to get away from the city and enjoy some sun, sea and sand. I thought it would be rude not to check it out while I was in the area. I must admit, I was quite disappointed, in the beach at least. It was very dirty, I guess due to the huge numbers of people who flock there at the weekend. The best beach I came across in Vietnam by far, was at Hoi An, and I didn't spend any time on it! I do slightly regret that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vung Tau luckily does have more to offer than its beaches. Ontop of Mount Nho, after a gentle seven hundred step climb lies the Christ of Vung Tau - a thirty two metre high statue of Jesus. Just in case you weren't exhausted enough from the hike up the mountain, there are an additional one hundred and thirty three steps inside the statue itself. The climb up these is well worth the effort, however. At the top you can exit onto the outstretched arms of Christ, affording a magnificent view across Vung Tau:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7460438186/" title="Saigon-60 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8020/7460438186_3321214e63.jpg" alt="Saigon-60"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7460482402/" title="Saigon-65 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7265/7460482402_6b5dc83598.jpg" alt="Saigon-65"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7460463272/" title="Saigon-63 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7460463272_a0c7e2c97b.jpg" alt="Saigon-63"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7460475086/" title="Saigon-64 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7460475086_3356d540e5.jpg" alt="Saigon-64"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7460456778/" title="Saigon-62 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7249/7460456778_3b66ca693d.jpg" alt="Saigon-62"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7460447470/" title="Saigon-61 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8149/7460447470_f9745f66fb.jpg" alt="Saigon-61"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed Ho Chi Minh City and the surrounding area, I thought personally it was nicer than Hanoi, but not the nicest place I visited in Vietnam. That one is a really tough decision in fact. It's a choice between Sapa, Hoi An and Da Lat. Each of those places are quiet and peaceful and I'm fast learning I prefer that environment to the busy cities. Having said that, it's far easier to meet people in hostels and go out for drinks and things in the evenings when you're in a vibrant city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing remains constant regardless of where I visit though, the time seems to fly past and before I know it I need to move on to my next stop. From Ho Chi Minh, I ride across the border to a brand new country; Cambodia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/4433161157024959644/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/ho-chi-minh-city.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/4433161157024959644'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/4433161157024959644'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/07/ho-chi-minh-city.html' title='Ho Chi Minh City'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-2957184456005173155</id><published>2012-06-28T10:26:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:27:40.503+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Da Lat'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vietnam'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hanoi'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Nha Trang'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Khe Sanh'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hoi An'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Dong Hoi'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Saigon'/><title type='text'>Hanoi to Saigon - Part Two</title><content type='html'>Day five should have seen us arrive in Khe Sanh after a two hundred kilometre journey through the most remote roads yet encountered. We hit a snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We knew from speaking to the hotel owner the night before, that we would not even see another hotel until we arrived in Khe Sanh. This should not have been a problem with a decent day of riding, but as we began steadily climbing into the hills Raj began to have problems with her gears. For some reason she was unable to change down into a lower gear as the bike struggled to climb the steep road, meaning the bike would stall and she would come rolling to a halt. Add to that, it is then more difficult to pull away when you are facing uphill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continued for a while like this, until it became apparent that at our current pace, we did not stand a chance of reaching our destination before dark. We were forced to turn around and head back to where we came from, which was very deflating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found a mechanic, who spent the next hour or so working on Raj's bike. She seemed much happier with it after that. Due to us now being unable to reach our intended destination that day, we decided to ride around fifty kilometres to Dong Hoi (in a different direction to our intended route) where we would find some ATM machines to withdraw some much needed money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey there was uneventful, and we happily found an ATM without difficulty. It's surprising just how much you take these things for granted! We ate an early dinner, and were riding back to the hotel when it started raining heavily. Not a problem, simply pull over and throw on your waterproof ponchos and carry on at a slower pace. Except my bike didn't want to carry on. In fact it didn't even want to start. It was as if it had decided it didn't like me anymore and had just given up completely. I rolled it to the second mechanic that day, demonstrating the hugely annoying problem to him. He immediately went straight for the spark plug, replaced it with a new one and started the bike first time. I Love it when things are that simple! To make things even better, it had stopped raining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, with the day we were having things were sure to get complicated again - very quickly. After fixing my bike, we were almost back at the hotel when it began raining heavily again. We were at the last turn for the road our hotel was on so I indicated, gradually braked and turned off the main road. Raj was customarily behind me, with Joakim following, so having made the corner I looked in my mirror to make sure Raj was still back there. It was at this moment I saw her slam straight into a low brick wall surrounding a kind of flower bed just beyond the corner. The bike came to an abrupt stop and Raj was catapulted over the bars, landing unceremoniously in the hedge/flower bed behind the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to explain what goes through your mind in moments like this. Part of me wasn't actually sure if it was really happening or not. I swung the bike around and rushed back to the scene, where I saw Joakim had just arrived. There were also some shocked locals who had been waiting out the rain just near the corner and saw the whole thing happen. As I got nearer I saw Raj standing up looking dazed. Thank God for that, I thought. She was holding her side, unsurprisingly in some pain, but after checking her over she appeared to have no injuries. I'm still not sure how she managed this, but I think we all realise - especially Raj - how very lucky she was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the bike didn't look too healthy. The wheel was completely buckled, the mirror had snapped off, the bars looked very bent and who knows what else wasn't quite 'right' with it. We managed to get the bike to a mechanic thanks to a resourceful young local who scooted off on his 'moto' returning with a long iron bar which we put through the buckled front wheel. We lifted the bar so one end was resting on my bike seat to the left, and one end on Joakim's to the right, with Raj's wheel resting on the bar in the middle. With the whole front end of the bike lifted off the ground like this, we were able to slowly walk the bikes along the road, Raj's rolling on the rear wheel only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raj went straight to bed after reaching the hotel. Frankly, I can't blame her. Joakim and I stayed up a while longer discussing the incident over some beer. We agreed on two things. The bike would not be very quickly repaired the next day (if at all), and Raj would be very sore in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rising early, we found we were correct on both counts. We heard from the hotel manager - who had kindly contacted the mechanic - that the bike would not be ready until 1:30pm. I was actually shocked it would be done that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raj also confirmed she was aching all over, and had little inclination to even look at her bike that day, let alone ride it. She suggested Joakim and I go on ahead, and she would catch us up further along the route. We weren't really happy to do this if it meant she would be riding alone, and suggested an alternative option would be to sell the bike in Dong Hoi where we'd gone to find an ATM the day before, and she could get a bus or a train to Hoi An where we would meet up again. After a chat to the hotel manager he confirmed this would be entirely possible, and he would take Raj and her bike to Dong Hoi for a fee, so she didn't have to ride there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new plan in place, we said our farewells and Joakim and I set off on the road through the mountains to Khe Sanh that we'd begun the previous day. The road was long, exhausting, but beautiful, and we were sad that Raj could not enjoy it with us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7351360218/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7236/7351360218_b5179f7ba7.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we arrived we found out that she had discovered she could transport herself and her bike on the train from Dong Hoi to Hoi An. She had booked her ticket and was all set to meet us there when we arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We set off from Khe Sanh after an early start, but not more than one hundred metres down the road I discovered a problem. My ignition barrel had snapped in half down the middle. Again, I can only attribute this to my phenomenal strength when putting the key in and turning it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be a five minute job to rip out the barrel and replace it with a new one. 60,000 Vietnamese Dong (or £1.84!) later, we were on our way. The roads coming out of town were some of most fun yet, long sloping corners round the base of mountains, easily taken at high speed safely due to the freshly laid tarmac. Amazing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We felt it getting steadily hotter as we approached the coast and travelled further south. We also encountered the infamous Highway 1 for the first time on our journey. This is the main road linking Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and consequently it's packed with huge lorries, coaches and maniacal cars all travelling between the two. In stark contrast to the beginning of the day, this road was horrible! However, as bad as the traffic was we made excellent time due to the straightness of the road and the decent surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finished off the day on a high (literally) as we rode over Hai Van Pass before descending towards Hoi An. The trucks and cars here get demoted to a boring tunnel, while bikes are free to enjoy the twisty roads in peace. Possibly some of the best views yet from this road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166198839/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7166198839_ffb79552c4.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166166741/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7213/7166166741_1ddcf21366.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166157481/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7077/7166157481_037434281a.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430339704/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/7430339704_b9bea77911.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Hoi An we discovered Raj had booked into an eighty dollar a night resort. This is compared to the fifteen or so we'd be paying. She said she needed pampering. I think she bumped her head in the crash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoi An is the place to come to get clothes tailored in Vietnam. Everywhere you go you will find a tailor, presenting their goods on mannequins at the front of their store. With this much choice it's hard to know where to spend your money, so I went with the one with seemingly the best reputation online, Yaly. You will be sat down when you arrive and handed multiple books with countless fashion photos allowing you to pick out a style you want for your clothing, if you do not already know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You then get measured up, and choose the fabric you want from a bewildering range on offer. I went with one dark grey suit, one light grey, a dark grey overcoat, a blue blazer and some shirts. These then got sent home so I don't need to worry about travelling with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, Hoi An is also the place to come if you want to experience the sweetest waitress ever. Go to Ganesh, the Indian restaurant and every time she greets you it will be with a cute "excuse me!" ... would you like another beer? excuse me! ... are you finished? and so on. Joakim and I both agreed we could do with one of those at home and were quite ready to carry her as a passenger to the next stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Hoi An, we travelled further down the coast to Nha Trang, Raj by bus (with her bike) and Joakim and I riding. This is party central, a typical beach resort type place. It was a nice enough area, but a little too crowded for my liking. The beach was also not as nice as we found at Hoi An, but regrettably did not spend any time at as we expected Nha Trang to be better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7351416648/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7236/7351416648_d4cb56e833.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The beach at Hoi An where we should have stayed!...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nha Trang had nice crabs though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430355436/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7269/7430355436_791edd79a5.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430351686/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7430351686_8fd797ab03.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also constantly be hassled by people trying to sell you things. On one such amusing occasion, it was the turn of a young boy who had a bunch of images whereby if you turned them by a certain number of degrees in either direction, the image would change. After a few failed attempts at impressing us with puppies playing together happily, or flowers coming into bloom, he rummaged around in the bottom of his box to produce an image of an attractive young lady, who got her breasts out as you turned it round. We found this hilarious, he was clearly a professional at judging his audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Da Lat could not have been more different from Nha Trang. A short one hundred and forty kilometer ride away, you're in cooler air, a more peaceful area and generally a nicer atmosphere. This is where locals come for their honeymoon, and you rarely see foreigners around, which is a nice treat. There is a big lake which is a magnet for locals (and visitors alike). Seemingly every child in town came out each day to fly kites by the side of the lake, a breathtaking sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430359518/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5239/7430359518_96c9db8789.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430336064/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8150/7430336064_d8ccb0f2de.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raj sold her bike in Da Lat. She said it seemed like a fitting place to leave her, a nice resting place if you will. She made the final leg of the journey by bus and Joakim and I carried on by bike, to our final destination; Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived and all of the effort and early starts had been worth it. It's quite a sense of achievement to say you've travelled the length of Vietnam,  over eighteen hundred kilometers from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City I can tell you. There are inevitably high and low points, but at the end of the day none of that matters. You can look back on an incredible journey and know that regardless, you enjoyed every single second of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a few random images taken by Joakim along the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430338628/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8028/7430338628_1de6aec62e.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;A short detour that didn't quite pay off, nice ride though!...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430337142/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7125/7430337142_3641af46ff.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Local kids laughing at the foreigners!...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430337836/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5466/7430337836_13b2e2b376.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The marathon day from part one we thought would never end...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7430340190/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/7430340190_b5f8cd90f8.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mechanic fixing a puncture on my bike..,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2957184456005173155/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/06/hanoi-to-saigon-part-two.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2957184456005173155'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2957184456005173155'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/06/hanoi-to-saigon-part-two.html' title='Hanoi to Saigon - Part Two'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1625284744487697257</id><published>2012-06-15T14:58:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T07:24:50.581+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vietnam'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hanoi'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Saigon'/><title type='text'>Hanoi to Saigon - Part One</title><content type='html'>This was it, the big one. The Northwest Loop was just the practice run, this was the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Nanning I had met a cool Norwegian guy named Joakim. We had kept in touch via email, and coincidentally he was arriving in Hanoi shortly after I had intended to begin my journey. A friend of his named Raj was also due to fly in to meet him, so we all arranged to ride south together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rocked up at the local motorbike market, with an amazingly friendly local guy we'd run into named Dung (pronounced Doo-ng before you start laughing!). He actually took time out of his weekend to take us here, purely because he didn't want to see us get ripped off too badly by other more 'touristy' places. Just one example of the great kindness shown by Vietnamese people since I've been here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raj needed some more money to buy her motorbike. She headed off in search of an ATM and still hadn't returned one hour later. We became increasingly worried. Each of us - including the motorbike dealer, I can only assume because he didn't want to lose a sale! - headed out on bikes searching for her with little success. She eventually showed up around two hours after she'd left, explaining how she'd been clipped by a motorbike while crossing the road, and had been getting looked after by a kind local shopkeeper for all that time. The start of the journey wasn't the smoothest we'd hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Joakim's and Raj's bikes purchased, we faced our next obstacle. Raj had never ridden a motorbike before - and as I've mentioned previously, the Hanoi traffic isn't exactly the easiest of introductions to riding you could ever have. As Joakim had one or two days prior experience, we agreed that I would carry Raj on the back of my motorbike, with her wearing my backpack. Joakim would ride his own bike and once we had got out of the worst of the traffic, Raj and Joakim would wait there and have a riding lesson or two, while I got a taxi back to the market to pick up Raj's bike and her bags. This was all perfect, except that due to the unavoidable delays we'd had earlier in the day, by the time we'd all reached the outskirts of Hanoi with all of the bikes, it was already getting dark. We headed to the nearest guesthouse, which luckily was very close, and rested up in preparation for an early start the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early start saw Raj crash. It was a relatively minor crash as far as crashes go, but I'm still pretty sure you can call it a crash. She didn't break heavily enough for some slow moving bicycles we came across, shot past the side of me, round the bicycles, into the bumpy, muddy ditch by the side of the road, and inevitably ended up with the bike tipped over on its side ontop of her. She sustained scrapes and bruises, she was lucky. The bike picked up the same injury as my own during the fun Northwest Loop "Hell Day". The footpeg had been bent up, making changing gear impossible. We got the bike to the nearest mechanic, who managed to bend the peg back into position, and we were (in theory) ready to roll again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after the ditch excursion Joakim and I were hesitant to say the least. We explained to Raj how dangerous we thought the situation was, as she looked very unsteady and uneasy on the bike. She was insistent though, that we carry on regardless as she was fine and she was getting the hang of the bike. I disagreed but something I've come to learn is that it's almost impossible to change Raj's mind once she's made it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We set off again, at a slower pace than before, and made it onto a much quieter road where Raj was able to settle into riding a bit more. Nearing the end of the day, we saw a guesthouse and decided to stop for the night. I'm not even sure where we were, at this point nowhere near big towns or cities, just riding through the tiniest villages in the middle of nowhere.  The following day was much the same, making steady progress along the Ho Chi Minh Highway, a road which runs from north to south. We were to follow this road for much of our route, taking diversions onto other roads where necessary. Our stop that evening saw us drink a few too many alcoholic beverages (I believe they call them"beers"). This unsurprisingly made the early start the next morning all the more difficult. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out the temptation to drink any more that evening would not be a problem for me anyway, as I had conveniently run out of money. I had not anticipated the lack of any major towns or cities (and the ATM's these would bring) along the route, and obviously did not withdraw enough before leaving Hanoi. Luckily between us we had enough to cover food and accommodation until we reached the next big place, but it was touch and go for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166124099/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7166124099_01ce74077a.jpg"  alt="Hanoi to Saigon-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166101043/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7245/7166101043_aa33d4b550.jpg"  alt="Hanoi to Saigon-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166111977/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7233/7166111977_c5e4e34223.jpg"  alt="Hanoi to Saigon-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7166140145/" title="Hanoi to Saigon-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7217/7166140145_1c73bc447d.jpg" alt="Hanoi to Saigon-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had intended to have a marathon stretch the next day to try and make up some of the time we'd lost at the beginning. We didn't realise at the time exactly how much of a marathon  it would turn into. We made good progress all day, keeping up a decent average speed. But as it got towards the end of what we considered to be enough of a run for one day, we discovered we were unable to find a guesthouse or hotel at any of the places we were riding through. We managed to find out from a villager in extremely broken English, that the nearest place to have a hotel was some twenty kilometres away. This is not something you particularly want to hear when you are already exhausted, and it is beginning to get dark. We wearily rode on, eventually getting to our destination after riding for five minutes in the dark. Not a pleasant experience on Vietnamese roads. I was so glad to see the neon lights of the hotel that night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, that was slightly later than Joakim, as he'd made the turn off the main road to the hotel, after seeing the sign. Unfortunately with it being dark, I didn't notice him turn and rode on a couple of kilometres further down the road, with Raj behind me. We soon realised our mistake, and turned back around, to find Joakim heading towards us having guessed our error. Happily reunited, we checked in and ate some much needed food, drank some much needed beer (becoming a theme) and gladly retired to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1625284744487697257/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/06/hanoi-to-saigon-part-one.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1625284744487697257'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1625284744487697257'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/06/hanoi-to-saigon-part-one.html' title='Hanoi to Saigon - Part One'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-5082285145695430793</id><published>2012-05-26T18:17:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-05-26T18:32:50.828+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vietnam'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mai Chau'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Son La'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sapa'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lai Chau'/><title type='text'>Vietnam by Motorbike</title><content type='html'>So I bought a motorbike. A "Honda Win" that isn't actually a Honda, but a cheap copy. But it's called a "Win" so you already know it's amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 110 or 115cc (I forget) of raw, unbridled power. This beast of a machine has greatness unequaled by the Gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had a thirty minute taster session on a motorbike before, but the way I figure it, Hanoi is the perfect place to learn, the traffic here is so forgiving and quiet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7268793330/" title="Hanoi-36 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7099/7268793330_fe5608f879.jpg" alt="Hanoi-36"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7267841806/" title="Hanoi-35 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7081/7267841806_14f691c994.jpg" alt="Hanoi-35"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people, I'd seen the Top Gear Vietnam special. I loved the idea of travelling around the country on two wheels. And frankly, if Jeremy Clarkson - the idiot, who I do actually like - can do it, I certainly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got off to a jerky start. It's tricky to get the hang of changing gears at first, and I stalled plenty of times, giving the little old ladies at their stalls in the Old Quarter something to chuckle at. I soon figured out that pulling away in second gear is a much smoother option, and the foot gear lever really doesn't need as much effort as I was putting in at first, which saved my (sandalled) feet some pain. There's no doubt that having driven a car before helped me to pick things up quicker. For someone unfamiliar with the clutch and gears, I think it would take them quite a bit longer to get accustomed to riding a manual bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get an idea of just what the traffic here is like, the following YouTube video was taken by me on a random trip trough the city, back to my hostel. The editing is very shoddy, but I had to get it under fifteen minutes, and I wasn't exactly going for an Oscar. If you notice, at 09:50 minutes there's a crash - which I surprisingly haven't seen too many of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2lAIchD1jZk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So having become an expert motorcyclist in just a couple of days, I was ready for my first big adventure - The Northwest Loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what it says on the tin. Starting from Hanoi you ride a loop up to Sapa, stopping overnight at various places in-between, then back down to Hanoi again. The length of time taken to do this varies, but I'd heard six to seven days was a leisurely pace, so that's what I was aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set out amongst the mid morning traffic, heading out of the madness that is Hanoi. The road soon quietened down, and it was actually a fairly pleasant ride to my first stop, Mai Chau. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately after stopping to check my phone for a potential place to sleep, a guy on a motorbike pulled up next to me and tried to convince me to come and stay in his sister's home-stay. I agreed to at least go and have a look, in the absence of a better option, and I'm very glad I did because the place was beautiful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240010984/" title="Northwest Loop-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5111/7240010984_6923f20979.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240005018/" title="Northwest Loop-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7219/7240005018_34f6de2f6e.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop on the route was Son La. I didn't actually get any photos here, but here's some of the views from the journey which more than make up for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7239989056/" title="Northwest Loop-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/7239989056_040d3c61fd.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240019916/" title="Northwest Loop-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5339/7240019916_49c211594f.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240027034/" title="Northwest Loop-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7220/7240027034_a0450801ae.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240035996/" title="Northwest Loop-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7095/7240035996_4b71a4031c.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These roads were just perfect. They wound their way up through the mountains, providing spectacular views and they were all smooth, sealed and intact! On the third day, that all changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travelling from Son La to Lai Chau shall forever more be referred to as"Hell Day". The first part of the day - before stopping for lunch - lulled me into a false sense of security. The roads were fine, and the going was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditions soon changed. The road suddenly disappeared and basically turned to rubble. Gone was the nice, smooth tarmac I'd been used to. In it's place were rocks, gravel, potholes and puddles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought this was a temporary glitch. The road would soon be reinstated and I'd be motoring along at a decent pace just like the first two days riding. I was gravely mistaken. It continued like this for the rest of the day. The going was slow and arduous, winding through mountain after mountain, and at one point I doubted I'd reach my destination before dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I thought things couldn't get any bleaker, I came across mud for the first time in my biking "career". I think I went too slowly and in too low a gear as the bike slipped to the side and I was unable to stop it as my foot also slid in the mud. The end result of this was a footpeg that had been bent up and no longer allowed me to change gear. I managed to bend it back down to the correct level, but it was then too far backwards. It was as I was bending it further forward that the footpeg and stand both snapped off in my hand. I can only attribute this to my superhuman strength:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240044628/" title="Northwest Loop-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7235/7240044628_901baedf90.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm no mechanic, but shouldn't this be attached?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, when this happened I was filled with happiness and joy. I rode for the next twenty kilometres with my left foot all the way back on the pillion peg, bringing my whole foot forward every time I had to change gear. It was uncomfortable to say the least, and by the time I got to my destination and found a place to stay, I was well and truly over my initial enthusiasm for the bike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning saw me get up nice and early to find a local mechanic. This is easily done in Vietnam, everywhere you go there will be someone available to help you out. I got the peg welded up for approximately £1.50. Ridiculously expensive, I think you'll agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the bike repaired, I set off with renewed enthusiasm for my next stop, Sapa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240422964/" title="Northwest Loop-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7237/7240422964_d39a521f5a.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240436298/" title="Northwest Loop-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7083/7240436298_10a01d6d0f.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240416562/" title="Northwest Loop-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5155/7240416562_9c02aa2a54.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240410838/" title="Northwest Loop-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7229/7240410838_831a6d2c0e.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240336538/" title="Northwest Loop-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7075/7240336538_cc9ae7f5a5.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240233186/" title="Northwest Loop-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5469/7240233186_b665c5abff.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240223588/" title="Northwest Loop-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7084/7240223588_85fa5ee94d.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240112852/" title="Northwest Loop-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5280/7240112852_13f332f79b.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240076764/" title="Northwest Loop-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8164/7240076764_6cb563a253.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240316808/" title="Northwest Loop-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8150/7240316808_d9d06da30d.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapa is really quite stunning, and so picturesque. The downside to this is its popularity with tourists, which does somewhat ruin the atmosphere of the place, but a short walk out of the main area can soon see you alone on a hillside path, enjoying incredible views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One such place, that gradually becomes quieter as you ascend higher (I can't think why) is Ham Rong Mountain. This had a very nice botanical gardens (I'm not so much into flowers but they can make a nice photo) and a "Cloud yard" which was the highest point on the mountain and provided me with the best views yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240442178/" title="Northwest Loop-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7092/7240442178_76f4ed48b0.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240450798/" title="Northwest Loop-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8150/7240450798_302d86fb51.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240457784/" title="Northwest Loop-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7230/7240457784_caf09f1e1d.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240479560/" title="Northwest Loop-25 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7240479560_5b76086066.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240489302/" title="Northwest Loop-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7216/7240489302_70211b57b0.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240529832/" title="Northwest Loop-27 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5350/7240529832_0ba4842d04.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-27"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240542200/" title="Northwest Loop-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7217/7240542200_fe747cbc3e.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7240561642/" title="Northwest Loop-29 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7231/7240561642_f449026941.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short walk further down from the main Sapa thoroughfare, sees you arrive in Cat Cat village. This is supposed to be an authentic Hmong village, but of course caters hugely to the tourists that now visit there. The thing I most enjoyed there was the Tien Sa waterfall, but the views on the way down were equally as pleasant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7268858946/" title="Northwest Loop-31 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7213/7268858946_f10b210309.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-31"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7268873444/" title="Northwest Loop-32 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7094/7268873444_836391a6e6.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-32"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7268898156/" title="Northwest Loop-33 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7239/7268898156_e099aa78f6.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-33"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7268974316/" title="Northwest Loop-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7228/7268974316_e1ed4669c7.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7270965572/" title="Northwest Loop-35 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7270965572_b600a5beb2.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-35"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7270970860/" title="Northwest Loop-36 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7102/7270970860_501c1a9440.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-36"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7270980496/" title="Northwest Loop-37 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7076/7270980496_deaa8f388f.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7270989576/" title="Northwest Loop-38 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7270989576_15a26ede76.jpg" alt="Northwest Loop-38"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total I spent four nights in Sapa, which was longer than I'd intended, but it really did warrant the extra time in my opinion. I had also heard that the roads back down to Hanoi from there were not the nicest in the world, and what's commonly done is to put yourself and your bike on a train from nearby Lao Cai, which is exactly what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived back in Hanoi on the 23rd, which is where I've been since. Despite the dreadful third day of travel, I've not been put off the bike. I'm now in planning for the next trip.

It didn't take me long to feel like sticking screwdrivers through my eardrums rather than listen any longer. Looking back on it, I have no idea why I didn't put my headphones in and listen to some Aqua or Britney Spears. I can only assume I was somehow brainwashed by the shockingly bad singing and psychedelic videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Hanoi makes it all worthwhile though. Aside from being physically accosted by 'moto' and taxi drivers as soon as I stepped off the bus, I was happy to get here. As it turns out, I didn't actually have a clue where 'here' was, so I did end up taking a moto (a ride on the back of a motorbike for a small fare) to my hostel. That alone was an experience in itself, the place is massive and packed full of backpackers from all over using the bar, restaurant and computers there. I could barely hear the girl checking me in down in the reception area, quite a change from others I've been in where it's just me and a few other people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm staying in the Old Quarter, and when you step out on the narrow streets you had better have your wits about you, or you'll easily get hit by a car or a motorbike. The pavements aren't actually pavements, they're simply used as motorbike parking. Pedestrians effectively walk in the gutter, bicycles and motorbikes are slightly further over and cars/vans/buses occupy the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will regularly be occasions where you have to stop walking as there's no more room left in the road when a car comes through, and the motorbikes divert around it directly into your path. For this reason I tend to prefer walking on the left hand side of the road so I can see the traffic coming at me and if necessary jump out of the way accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoan Kiem Lake is in the historical centre of Hanoi, and is generally a good place to start sightseeing and getting your bearings from. Turtle Tower stands in the middle of the lake, and further along you have the Temple of the Jade Mountain also on its own island:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195516312/" title="Hanoi-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7195516312_0ba5c54788.jpg" alt="Hanoi-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195504678/" title="Hanoi-11 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7222/7195504678_e17be09082.jpg" alt="Hanoi-11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195421116/" title="Hanoi-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7072/7195421116_61179c155b.jpg" alt="Hanoi-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195450598/" title="Hanoi-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7218/7195450598_0fe5117205.jpg" alt="Hanoi-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195492630/" title="Hanoi-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7216/7195492630_bac25f8c18.jpg" alt="Hanoi-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was while I was down at the lake having a well earned rest on a bench that I got chatting to a Chinese girl named Vicki. She was staying in Hanoi with a friend for a short while and had already been wandering around the city getting lost for a couple of days (her sense of direction is woeful) but still enjoying herself all the same! We ended up hanging out together for the next few days, going on tours and checking out the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We first went on a day trip to Hoa Lu, which used to be the capital of Vietnam before Hanoi. We visited temples which were built for emperors Dinh Tien Hoang and Le Dai Hanh, their sons, and Queen Duong Van Nga. This was all very nice, it's just a shame you couldn't walk ten metres without a local trying to sell you hats, drinks or fans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the temples we had lunch, which was a buffet style affair. I tried some fried, roasted and grilled goat. I wimped out the first time around, but got some on my next plateful. It actually wasn't all that bad, tasted like chicken (not really).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we took a short drive to the village of Tam Coc, where we boarded small rowing boats and took a trip along the river, passing under three limestone tunnels. Look closely and you'll see these villagers rowing with their FEET. I have no words to describe how awesome they are. They were proper cheeky buggers though, we had already been advised by the guide that a tip is appropriate, so we had ready 20,000 dong each (there were two ladies rowing our boat). Instead of waiting for us to turn round after the end of the ride, they forcefully prodded us in our backs and demanded "tip, tip!". We handed the two notes over, advising there was one for each lady, and one of them tried keeping both then asking for more! We politely refused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195522600/" title="Hanoi-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7084/7195522600_df9f5fc990.jpg" alt="Hanoi-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195527968/" title="Hanoi-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7223/7195527968_dbd92ef768.jpg" alt="Hanoi-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195547024/" title="Hanoi-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7195547024_e7be9677e7.jpg" alt="Hanoi-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195636948/" title="Hanoi-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/7195636948_6f1b8e3146.jpg" alt="Hanoi-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195644102/" title="Hanoi-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8009/7195644102_50de499e0c.jpg" alt="Hanoi-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195649288/" title="Hanoi-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7077/7195649288_4901453d56.jpg" alt="Hanoi-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195658524/" title="Hanoi-18 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7093/7195658524_27f2da428a.jpg" alt="Hanoi-18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day we visited Hoa Lo Prison, sarcastically referred to as the 'Hanoi Hilton' by US prisoners of war who were imprisoned there. Most of the prison was demolished, but what remains has been made into a museum, there are also some of the original cells. The museum made a point of emphasising how well treated the American POW's were during their stay at the facility, but apparently torture was commonplace. It was a very sobering place, with an eerie atmosphere to it, especially looking into the cells through the old spy holes in the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night we went to a Korean restaurant where you cooked your own food at the table. I had never been to a place like this before, and it was a really fun experience (if a little hot!). The food tasted lovely, all thanks to pro chef Vicki:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7196046608/" title="Camera Roll-403 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/7196046608_853237f5c3.jpg" alt="Camera Roll-403"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may sound a little odd visiting a Korean restaurant in Vietnam, but I'd never been and just fancied a change. I'd had no shortage of Vietnamese food by this stage, and it tastes amazing. My favourites are Pho, which is basically a noodle soup which you can have with chicken or beef, and Bun Cha which is skewered pork served with noodles and a tasty soup thing again which you put some of the noodles into, along with some of the pork, then some salad (don't ask me what, just green leaves!) and eat all together. Repeat the process. It tastes delicious! I don't have any pictures though. Mental note, start taking photos of my food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also visited the army museum, which I unfortunately didn't get any photos of. But they did have some nice old planes and tanks and things to wander around. They also had the wreckage of a bomber which was shot down during the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicki had to go back to Beijing the next day, where she's studying. She had already extended her stay longer than she'd originally intended anyway, so had no choice but to go back. I booked the next tour for myself for the following day, to Halong Bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a two day, one night tour, sleeping on the boat. You get picked up from Hanoi and driven to the harbour where you sail out to Bai Tu Long Bay - a quiet part of Halog Bay where only one or two companies are licensed to go. I deliberately chose this, as while it was slightly more expensive I thought it'd be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get to visit Thien Canh Son Cave, go kayaking for a few hours, swim from a white sandy beach for around an hour and the next day visit Vung Vieng floating fishing village before returning to Hanoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has probably been my favourite thing so far. The boat was POSH, the kayaking was so much fun, the scenery was fantastic and lying out on the deck at night under the stars with nothing but silence and a nice cold beer was so relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people were also very cool, there was only sixteen in total so it was easy to get chatting with everyone. I was sat on a table with three people from Melbourne (Des, Rhonda and their son, Phil), as I was on my own and so it made up a four. Des actually managed to pick up Irish in my voice, I couldn't quite believe it and I'm still not actually sure how this is possible. My Dad's side of the family is Irish, but I've lived in England all my life, how does that work?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7195747414/"

Don't leave your debit card in an ATM. They're useful to help you get cash, which in turn helps you to live. Luckily I bought a spare card which I'm getting money with, but I'm paying a charge, the one I lost was free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, it's not my fault! The machines here are the opposite to the UK, cash first, THEN card. Stupid ATM. Phoned the bank to cancel the card and a replacement was ordered. My parents have received it back at home so now it's just working out the best way to get it sent out here! What a pain in the arse.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/999633032785295466/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/05/arrival-in-hanoi.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/999633032785295466'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/999633032785295466'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/05/arrival-in-hanoi.html' title='Arrival in Hanoi'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-3991809586919201607</id><published>2012-05-12T11:24:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-05-25T16:01:34.579+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Nanning'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='China'/><title type='text'>Arrival in Nanning</title><content type='html'>The first train journey on my trip so far was mercifully uneventful. It departed Guilin around 8am and only lasted four or five hours. I did manage to oversleep by around forty-five minutes, but luckily had left myself enough time anyway! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What appear to be no smoking signs as I know them from the UK, actually have completely the opposite meaning in China. These are designated smoking areas where people (including train staff) can gather and have a much needed cigarette during the long, tiring journey. Actually they were right by the toilets, maybe they're being considerate to their fellow passengers by masking the smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toilet was pretty funny. My advice is if you really, really must use the toilet on a train here, try and do so early. I managed to avoid it for the duration (preferring dehydration), others weren't so lucky. Someone very early on must have had really bad aim while they were laying some pipe, as every single person I saw for the remainder of the journey opened the door, gave a look of absolute disgust at the horror before them and turned right back round again. For locals to even do that, I'd imagine it was pretty bad. So here's some photos of the toilet from hell in all its shit splattered glory:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK not really. Those of you who want that kind of thing, there's other websites. Get off my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get to Nanning, and it's 35 degrees celsius. I'm from the UK, I didn't even know that temperature existed. Carrying my big pack (but still tiny compared to other backpackers, I don't know how they do it!) I predictably arrived at my hostel a sweaty mess. I've since come to learn that's a recurring theme and I just have to live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nanning is a really nice place, it has a very pleasant atmosphere to it. It's pretty funny walking around there getting stared at constantly by people, because there's so few Westerners there. Other than the people I met in my hostel I think I saw two. This actually turns you into something of a Z-list celebrity. I had a couple of people come up to me and ask to have a photo taken with me, presumably to stick on their refrigerator. Such a hard life being a celebrity and keeping your fans happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7153460499/" title="Nanning-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7117/7153460499_550fdcc0d3.jpg" alt="Nanning-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend Chan in the UK is from Nanning originally, so she gave me lots of help with people to see, places to go etc (thanks Chan you're a star!). One of the places she recommended was a small cultural relic park right near my hostel. I actually couldn't find much about this online but it was a very pretty place:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007322514/" title="Nanning-12 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7229/7007322514_e14dc32d9d.jpg" alt="Nanning-12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007344068/" title="Nanning-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5235/7007344068_3289206353.jpg" alt="Nanning-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7153425801/" title="Nanning-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7105/7153425801_7202df85b7.jpg" alt="Nanning-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7153452401/" title="Nanning-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7244/7153452401_91a90c3e5a.jpg" alt="Nanning-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007353344/" title="Nanning-15 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/7007353344_7866d298bc.jpg" alt="Nanning-15"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007254368/" title="Nanning-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7062/7007254368_d349664a25.jpg" alt="Nanning-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another recommendation from Chan - Qingxiu Mountain - was beautiful, but hard work! I stupidly walked straight past the electric shuttle buggy things at the front gate, only to massively regret that decision after an hour or two walking around.

It was a long bus journey to get there - four and a half hours - but it was definitely worth the trip and the early start. The water flow wasn't very strong, but it was still a magnificent sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007121150/" title="Nanning-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8028/7007121150_3531f30618.jpg" alt="Nanning-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007125786/" title="Nanning-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7188/7007125786_278a1c6413.jpg" alt="Nanning-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007144004/" title="Nanning-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7221/7007144004_eb66a24ce3.jpg" alt="Nanning-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007152526/" title="Nanning-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7007152526_090e6a3cb1.jpg" alt="Nanning-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007207846/" title="Nanning-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5344/7007207846_a22a4c674b.jpg" alt="Nanning-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7153316289/" title="Nanning-5 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8162/7153316289_a03267f30a.jpg" alt="Nanning-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7007238772/" title="Nanning-6 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5462/7007238772_f8db5e9981.jpg" alt="Nanning-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't get a chance to see much more of Nanning, as I was already delayed getting to Vietnam from my detour to Guilin.

I'd only been in Guilin half an hour and the airport shuttle bus driver nearly killed us by running straight through a red light. The thing is, at the time I thought that was a moment of madness. No. Everyone does it. All the time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour coach driver insisted on overtaking at breakneck speed - even when there were other coaches coming head on at us. He seemed to think using the horn would make them magically disappear somehow. They didn't. I'm not ashamed to admit I nearly shit myself on a number of occasions. As far as I can recall it's the only time I've actually been scared in a vehicle. I can only assume he was rushing back to an orgy with fifty hot Chinese women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horn here seems to mean "I'm in the middle of doing something ridiculously stupid, I'd advise you to get out of my way if you can". The red man at crossings means it's very unsafe to cross, people do it anyway. The green man STILL appears to mean it's very unsafe to cross, as people just drive straight through. Motorbikes and scooters ride down the wrong side of the road, on the pavements and with no lights on at night. Vehicles in general pull out into fast moving traffic apparently with no knowledge there are actually other things on the road with them and pedestrians wander out aimlessly into the firing line, safe in the knowledge their invisible forcefield will allow them to bounce majestically and harmlessly off the front of any oncoming car/coach/lorry and float gracefully back down to the asphalt. Anyway, like I said, insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I'm in Guilin! This wasn't in the original plan, but having been recommended to go there by my friends Chan and Lilian (my Hong Kong CouchSurfing host) it had to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't get off to the best of starts. We boarded the plane in Shenzhen, and proceeded to sit on the apron for an hour and a half (longer than the actual flight time would be). Fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then nearly died in the shuttle bus, which I've already shared. I finally made it to my hostel at 1am to check in, only for them to say there was no reservation for me, despite having booked online a few days before. After an hour of waving my arms around and trying to explain to the staff who could hardly speak English that I had reserved online, we searched through piles and piles of paperwork to find my booking. Thank God. Another thirty minutes later (while they cleaned my room!) and I was in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a lot of text, let's have some pretty pictures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the Sun and Moon pagodas in Shan Lake, which was just a few minutes walk from my hostel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6999035526/" title="Guilin-3 by luketwomey, on

The first part was four hours on a big boat cruising down the Li river to Yangshuo, where we had an hour of free time before heading to a small village for a couple of hours bamboo rafting. It was absolutely incredible. The limestone karsts provide a unique backdrop, it makes for quite an experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big boat had an upper deck (you can see an identical boat in one of the photos above) where I stood at the front and leant against the railing to take photos. I totally felt like Kate Winslet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a moment when I was getting on the bamboo raft, concentrating entirely on not toppling over and falling into the water, when I heard a loud PLONK. Oh. That's not good. I turned around and watched whatever it was sink down underneath the water, then confusingly pop back up again to the surface. It was my bottle of water in the side pocket of my bag! Phew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing I am struggling with so far is the language barrier. Hong Kong eased me in very gently, as lots of people speak English there due to it being an official language. Not so in China. I'm getting by (just) but it's harder than I expected it to be. Simply having English speaking hostel staff can be extremely useful. I moved to another hostel for my last night staying here, as I originally wasn't sure how long I would be in Guilin. I couldn't explain to the (non English) speaking staff at the first establishment that I wanted to stay another night, so I gave up and went to somewhere else. If I'd have persisted I'm sure we would have got there, but it was just easier to walk to somewhere else a few minutes down the road. These guys spoke perfect English and it's one less hassle for you to worry about. The hostel almost turns into a safe haven where you can go back and understand people again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night i did have a nightmare scenario where for half an hour or so my world imploded on me. I was running low on cash (I'd initially changed some Hong Kong dollars to Chinese yuan whilst still in Hong Kong) so tried to withdraw some money from the first cash machine I visited in China. I chose 1000 yuan (around £100). The machine thought about it for a good two minutes, spat out my card, printed out my receipt showing I'd withdrawn 1000 yuan, then nothing, no money. Shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again at the machine next to it... same thing, but this time no receipt. Oh shit, shit. Tried again with another card, same result. SHIT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time I was sweating profusely. This was a pretty bad situation to be in. Sure, not the worst thing that could possibly happen but at the time I was panicking and it felt like a total disaster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frantically searched for other banks along the road. I found the Bank of China. I tried again. The machine thought about it for what seemed like forever before dispensing some glorious money! Thank Christ for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I phoned up the other bank and gave them all the details of the three failed attempts. They said they're dealing with it, so I hope it gets sorted and I don't get screwed over. I'll check my account online and see what's happening there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story... erm, don't spend all your cash on rent boys? I don't know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a long one, thanks for sticking with it! Next up, Nanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/6437184479660391216/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/05/arrival-in-guilin.html#comment-form' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/6437184479660391216'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/6437184479660391216'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/05/arrival-in-guilin.html' title='Arrival in Guilin'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-7685956378919028469</id><published>2012-05-05T18:50:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2012-05-05T18:50:21.471+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hong Kong'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Macau'/><title type='text'>Macau and Farewell to Hong Kong</title><content type='html'>I'd read that a trip to Hong Kong wasn't complete without a visit to Macau. A big reason for this is the vast number of casinos in the place, but frankly that doesn't interest me in the slightest. I've never really understood gambling, the house will ALWAYS win - what's the point? It's just a guaranteed way of losing money... Anyway, the casinos aren't the only draw. There's some nice Portugese architectural sights to enjoy if you're into that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So up at 6 (I thought early starts died with leaving my job!) to hop on a ferry to Macau and catch up on an hour of much needed sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a tourist map from the ferry port, jumped on a bus and before I knew it I was at my first stop, Senado Square:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6988894206/" title="Macau-0 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7083/6988894206_d392ed9538.jpg" alt="Macau-0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is right in the centre of Macau and has nice wavy patterns in the pavement. I'm not sure if the Portuguese were drunk at the time or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ruins of St. Paul's, destroyed by fire in 1835:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6988924540/" title="Macau-1 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7232/6988924540_ae2c60f52f.jpg"  alt="Macau-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-Ma Temple, pre-dating Macau itself. Apparently the naming of Macau originated from the temple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7135035111/" title="Macau-2 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7093/7135035111_8f2bc63550.jpg" alt="Macau-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lilau Square, in an area where the Portugese first settled:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6998991168/" title="Macau-3 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8156/6998991168_21ea871c1f.jpg" alt="Macau-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macau is a very pretty place and so clean as well. That's something I've noticed both here and in Hong Kong - they're hard to miss - an army of street cleaners everywhere, sweeping up rubbish and hosing down pavements etc. It makes for a very good first impression of the places you arrive in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of food, I saw two things always mentioned that should be tried, egg tarts (a bit like custard tarts back in England) and beef jerky. Both were consumed, and both were delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about ready to move on, having seen pretty much everything I wanted to in Hong Kong. I made one last stop off at Kowloon Park - this time during the day - to get some photos of the birds there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6998723110/" title="Hong Kong-85 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7201/6998723110_2b4b87f801.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-85"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7144817149/" title="Hong Kong-86 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7144817149_f0102b9ece.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-86"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7144886611/" title="Hong Kong-87 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7181/7144886611_7d83fcc384.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6998807540/" title="Hong Kong-88 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7058/6998807540_4db280f0c6.jpg"  alt="Hong Kong-88"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7144941675/" title="Hong Kong-90 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8141/7144941675_4be33cb608.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a twitcher, let me know what these birds are!

Hands up if you've heard of it! No prizes if I already told you before, that's cheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is, you stay at the home of a local while on your travels. They offer you a couch/bed/sofa/floor out of the kindness of their heart, allowing you to learn about their culture. This presents a unique opportunity to bypass the typical hotel/hostel frequented by backpackers and really get to know the place you're staying in, as well as gaining a new friend to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, you're sceptical. Why would anyone do such a thing? What if you get an axe murderer? They like murdering things with axes right? Yes. They do. Fortunately though, you can read reviews from other travellers before staying with someone. This helps you avoid the weirdos and undesirables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had arranged to stay with Lilian before I left the UK. She kindly offered to host me for two nights on the nineteenth and twentieth of April. She's probably been the best thing about Hong Kong so far, so I'm glad she did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's put up with me, showed me around places I otherwise wouldn't have seen and generally been pretty amazing and lovely. If you had any doubts about CouchSurfing, I guarantee they'd be dispelled by a stay with Lilian!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first place she took me to was a small village called Nam Sang Wai. This is the last such village of its kind, and apparently the locals do appreciate tourists visiting due to the income it brings  (serving drinks, ferrying people across the river and so on). The difference between this place and the city couldn't be more obvious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960254390/" title="Hong Kong-36 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7259/6960254390_d602651088.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-36"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960262974/" title="Hong Kong-37 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8159/6960262974_ebf8925095.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960275562/" title="Hong Kong-38 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7268/6960275562_36df37baec.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-38"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106317655/" title="Hong Kong-35 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7072/7106317655_5434dd592c.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-35"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960237548/" title="Hong Kong-34 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6960237548_9b8b40cf67.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106370839/" title="Hong Kong-41 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7050/7106370839_0d70565236.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-41"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106353771/" title="Hong Kong-39 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7275/7106353771_95f1daf6fe.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-39"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960289148/" title="Hong Kong-40 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8024/6960289148_3e5b9fd1fc.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106284923/" title="Hong Kong-30 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8018/7106284923_3450d54c6f.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-30"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do worry how long it will remain intact, however. Lilian mentioned that the land had been sold to a property developer, the eventual conclusion I would imagine being eviction for the inhabitants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then walked the Ping Shan Heritage Trail. It was hot. I got tired and sweaty. By comparison Lilian looked fresh and like she'd just enjoyed a nice peaceful nap in an air conditioned room. I hope I adjust to the hotter climate soon - it's not even &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; hot, about twenty seven degrees that day. The highest so far has been twenty nine. The trail visits the 'Tang' village and various historical buildings in the area, giving an insight into Chinese life hundreds of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106376117/" title="Hong Kong-42 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8166/7106376117_252595a8a5.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-42"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960313796/" title="Hong Kong-43 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8156/6960313796_3227d9a7f9.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960321618/" title="Hong Kong-44 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7054/6960321618_2681c71967.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-44"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106394705/" title="Hong Kong-48 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8151/7106394705_8683ea2173.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-48"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106394063/" title="Hong Kong-47 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8165/7106394063_f83b2d3df3.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-47"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960323066/" title="Hong Kong-46 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7188/6960323066_2a331b1049.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've taken the ferry over to Lantau island, having dinner and a few drinks with a view like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6963774344/" title="Hong Kong-71 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7119/6963774344_324d258098.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-71"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7109855623/" title="Hong Kong-72 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7109855623_381a26310c.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-72"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've gone up to a viewpoint in the New Territories (where Lilian lives), looking North towards mainland China:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6963790700/" title="Hong Kong-73 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8156/6963790700_e866bf9f67.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-73"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've also been to many different (authentic) restaurants, for a taster of the best food Hong Kong has to offer - this was just breakfast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106393111/" title="Hong Kong-45 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7184/7106393111_513dbca9a3.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-45"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's even let me drive her car around to these places. Actually that's probably for the best as she can't really drive, she bumped into a barrier when she was parking it the other day. She didn't seem to mind too much, I laughed a fair bit. I could make a comment here about women drivers, but I'll resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get the chance, give CouchSurfing a shot. Pick your host carefully, and you'll be richly rewarded as I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while Lilian was busy on her course during the day, I was off exploring. I'm actually amazed just how tired this is making me. My feet are also killing me by the end of the day with all the walking I'm doing. I had to ditch my 'Keane' sandals (as recommended by Rob Kershaw - see my blog list in the sidebar) and have resorted to using bog standard flip flops, the wounds made on my feet are still healing. I've kept the Keanes and will try them with some below the ankle socks (super cool!) at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First up was a visit to Stanley Bay. They have a market there where I picked up my flip flops, but luckily for me they were holding Dragon Boat races in the bay:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960341966/" title="Hong Kong-50 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8016/6960341966_8dd9170b17.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106418341/" title="Hong Kong-51 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8001/7106418341_8211edab68.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-51"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960332882/" title="Hong Kong-49 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7219/6960332882_d4b21b894a.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-49"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really quite exciting, with the drummer at the front and the pace they're paddling at. Nobody fell in the water which I was slightly disappointed about, but you can't have everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point I needed to start getting to my next stop, so hopped on a bus - which went past Repulse Bay:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960357068/" title="Hong Kong-52 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8168/6960357068_e0d9bbc3cb.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-52"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn't know Hong Kong had beaches, now you do! If I had more time (and more sunny days!) I would have treated myself to a relaxing day on the beach, but I had more pressing things to do and see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has probably been my favourite thing so far. The view over Hong Kong from Victoria Peak:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960363388/" title="Hong Kong-53 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7133/6960363388_3ff4c9d0b0.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-53"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960370166/" title="Hong Kong-54 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/6960370166_774f6aa67a.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-54"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960189430/" title="Hong Kong-26 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8012/6960189430_ebdc2542c4.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been waiting for a nice enough day for this since I'd been here. For obvious reasons you don't really want to go up there when it's cloudy. I expected it to be incredible, and I wasn't disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've visited Central, where they have the longest escalator in the world (OK so it's lots of escalators connected with walkways but for some reason no one pays much attention to that). You get some nice views down some of the streets you pass over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960417956/" title="Hong Kong-60 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7204/6960417956_1d7dffdf46.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-60"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106507285/" title="Hong Kong-62 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8164/7106507285_c101165d84.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-62"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960451834/" title="Hong Kong-63 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/6960451834_1b55328bae.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-63"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106274389/" title="Hong Kong-28 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/7106274389_bd87a8b0cf.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hop on a tram which takes you from one side of Hong Kong island to another, perfect for capturing images of daily life on the bustling streets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106533227/" title="Hong Kong-64 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7095/7106533227_08ffbf5320.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-64"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960472978/" title="Hong Kong-65 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/6960472978_1d31670a0a.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-65"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106553317/" title="Hong Kong-66 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7106553317_2ecc088070.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-66"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960495062/" title="Hong Kong-67 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8160/6960495062_7020cd7a58.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-67"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7106571161/" title="Hong Kong-68 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7106571161_b5fe3ef3b7.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-68"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6960509986/" title="Hong Kong-69 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/6960509986_0860ff25e3.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-69"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And something not for those with a fear of heights, a cable car ride to Ngong Ping 360. This was a good experience, but it was slightly let down by the fact it was a cloudy day. The lower part of the ride was fine, but climbing higher into the mountains you literally couldn't see the car in front. The pictures show just how bad it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6963809108/" title="Hong Kong-76 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/6963809108_26b95a5a25.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-76"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6963815210/" title="Hong Kong-77 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5344/6963815210_dc144f9163.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-77"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6966839560/" title="Hong Kong-78 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7095/6966839560_37676a352c.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-78"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7112922247/" title="Hong Kong-79 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5115/7112922247_7d7fd5c666.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-79"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7112926589/" title="Hong Kong-80 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/7112926589_146847022e.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-80"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7112956025/" title="Hong Kong-83 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7112956025_14b5ae99f0.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-83"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6966856612/" title="Hong Kong-81 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/6966856612_5bece800af.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-81"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6966874324/" title="Hong Kong-82 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/6966874324_b91f78dec0.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-82"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bit of a long post this one, but I've had no time before now!

It's just so hard to get comfortable when you're bolt upright (save for a slightly reclining seat back). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food was OK (they must have fired Gordon due to foul language though). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Films were OK (watched Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Moneyball). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flight itself was OK (some fun turbulence where it felt like we were about to plunge to our deaths, but hey - they have to liven it up a bit, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions of Hong Kong... manic! There's countless people lining the pavements, all busy going about their day, or trying to tailor clothes for you, or trying to get you to stay in their hostel... If you love big cities, and everything very loud and full on, this is the place for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, when I arrived in my hostel room and plonked myself down on the bed, I was completely shell shocked. Thoughts like 'have I bitten off more than I can chew' did briefly enter my head! But having had more time since then I'm going to put that down to tiredness from the flight! I've had a good night's sleep since then and today's been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, don't come here if you're claustrophobic (or maybe just don't stay in a cheap as chips hostel). The room is tiny. Don't get me wrong, I knew what to expect before I arrived (and had also seen pictures) but it's a different thing entirely when you actually arrive! Actually, come to think of it - you'd never even make it up to the hostel in the tiniest lift you've ever seen, so it's a non-issue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some photos of my "cosy" room:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7092385963/" title="Hong Kong-19 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5112/7092385963_d01ceb2a64.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6946321426/" title="Hong Kong-20 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/6946321426_cc9ed578f2.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7092395405/" title="Hong Kong-21 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7134/7092395405_ec26560c8c.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6946331514/" title="Hong Kong-22 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7083/6946331514_61cae7efaa.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-22"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7092407263/" title="Hong Kong-23 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7092407263_6a6f6800c8.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The position of the shower is inspired. I'm not sure if this is representative of other hostels here, I'll find out soon enough. You also can't have too much pressure behind the water, or it all pools on the floor and overflows into the room. You can't expect much for £25 a night though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather here is cloudy with occasional light showers, which is a shame because it means the view of Hong Kong island from the Kowloon shoreline is very misty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7090990909/" title="Hong Kong-13 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5113/7090990909_2521ab0d53.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6944668660/" title="Hong Kong-7 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7227/6944668660_b5d51883fb.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7090789501/" title="Hong Kong-4 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5445/7090789501_61d8349bdb.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6944815478/" title="Hong Kong-8 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5076/6944815478_068c75d50e.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope it clears up for at least one of the days I'm here, as I want to take the tram to the top of Victoria Peak. This gives a fantastic view over the harbour and Hong Kong, but not with weather like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In complete contrast to the chaos on the streets, Kowloon Park is so tranquil and calm you could scarcely believe you're in the same city. I haven't even been there in the day yet, but at night it's amazing. The place is very big, but no matter which path you wander along you feel completely safe. I saw at least three security guards patrolling, but there's just a bunch of people in there going for a relaxing stroll or taking half an hour away from the madness outside the gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6944959628/" title="Hong Kong-16 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/6944959628_ae92a042fb.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7090912621/" title="Hong Kong-9 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5118/7090912621_f9a627805c.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6944867290/" title="Hong Kong-10 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5279/6944867290_342d483244.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/6944965382/" title="Hong Kong-17 by luketwomey, on Flickr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5467/6944965382_1709bda03d.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luketwomey/7091002107/" title="Hong Kong-14 by luketwomey, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5324/7091002107_1c90f04624.jpg" alt="Hong Kong-14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food situation's been fine so far. I know some people (including myself!) predicted this would be a big problem - for those that don't know, I'm a slightly fussy eater. The general rule I have is meat = good, veg = bad. There are a few exceptions but in general that holds true. I've stuck to things I know (crab dumplings, BBQ pork with rice, egg fried rice with prawns, skewered chicken and beef) and everything's been hunky dory. I&lt;br /&gt;Might decide to get more adventurous as time goes on, I'm just easing myself in gently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hostel I'm staying in doesn't have a common area, so I haven't really had a chance to meet anyone yet. I briefly chat to a Spanish guy I saw coming out of his room as we went down in the lift, but that's about it. But tonight I'm meeting my first Couchsurfing host, to stay with her for the next two nights. More on that in the next update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/2051879927238499902/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/04/arrival-in-hong-kong.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2051879927238499902'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/2051879927238499902'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/04/arrival-in-hong-kong.html' title='Arrival in Hong Kong'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-1620979846268757964</id><published>2012-04-16T16:00:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-04-25T17:37:47.041+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='England'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>D-Day (Departure Day)</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/1620979846268757964/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/04/d-day-departure-day.html#comment-form' title='9 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1620979846268757964'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/1620979846268757964'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/04/d-day-departure-day.html' title='D-Day (Departure Day)'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-8434087704458666261</id><published>2012-03-28T15:51:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-03-29T00:40:27.913+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='England'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Itinerary</title><content type='html'>Other than the order of the places I'm visiting, I'm trying to keep things as open as possible. This should afford me some spontaneity when it comes to deciding exactly what I'll be doing and when. The plan is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hong Kong -&gt; China -&gt; Vietnam -&gt; Cambodia -&gt; Laos -&gt; Thailand -&gt; Malaysia -&gt; Singapore -&gt; Australia -&gt; New Zealand -&gt; America (NY) -&gt; Home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey begins in Hong Kong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7182/7021844943_8a8ca87a3f.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Erm, wow...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I depart from Heathrow at 18:30 on the 16th April, arriving in Hong Kong International on the 17th April at 13:00 local time. That's an eleven and a half hour flight - I can't wait! Still, on the plus side I am flying first class with one of those fully flat bed things. OK I lied about that last bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should be in Hong Kong for a couple of weeks, maybe a little less. I'm trying to give myself a decent amount of time in each place. A good friend suggested two weeks may be longer than I'd need, having been there himself, but that's OK. I'd rather be in that situation than feel like I hadn't seen enough of a place before I had to leave. Next up, China:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6223/7022502437_753e3cace3.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nanning, Guangxi...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fleeting visit, staying briefly in Nanning. I'll be travelling overland from Hong Kong, through mainland China to get to Vietnam:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7248/7022535233_40b5804901.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Halong Bay...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm expecting to arrive in Vietnam at the beginning of May, staying there around one month. Next up, Cambodia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7193/6877873554_639e79a095.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Angkor Wat...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ain't that just a mighty fine lookin' temple? I am deliberately keeping all this very brief, as I'll be going into more detail on each country in the first blog post on arrival. After Cambodia is Laos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7207/7023814289_0f19e88d18.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vang Vieng...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I'll be here for approximately a month. From what I've read online these are decent lengths of time to get a good feel for each place. Thailand then follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7201/6877731484_2d936d55e2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Koh Chang (otherwise known as heaven if this photo is anything to go by)...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly longer staying here - two months as opposed to one. I've lost count of the number of ladyboy comments I've had when I mention I'm going to this place! Next up, Malaysia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6045/7023859583_de71fc6950.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kuala Lumpur...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I thought it looked pretty awesome too. One month for Malaysia before getting to Singapore:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7049/6877777702_e636decf43.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Singapore skyline...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a week here which apparently should be plenty of time. I then fly from Singapore on the 16th November, to Darwin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6102/6877799484_90b9a1c710.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kakadu National Park...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week here also, for the Kakadu National Park. I might get lost and have to live off the bush for the rest of my life though. All those years of watching Ray Mears should finally pay off. Next up is a flight to Alice Springs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6240/7023910075_b71e4aeaa0.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Uluru...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like rocks, really big rocks, here's the place to come. I'll be around for another week or so here before jumping on another plane to Cairns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7255/7023919949_47a5b91683.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Great Barrier Reef...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a dive. Ba dum tishhh... I then make my way down the east coast - over the space of about a month - to Sydney:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6098/6877843492_ae727535d6.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sydney Harbour...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be staying here with friends for a month or two - depending on how long they can stand the smell, and excessive nose picking. Next up, New Zealand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7023962245_6bd7dbbeb5.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Zealand...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting off in Christchurch then making my way up to Auckland over the space of a month. Then flying from Auckland to New York:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6043/6877879700_7e43872bd9.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times Square...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here for a couple of weeks before finally flying home to Croydon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6238/6877891660_432ed579c2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Croydon Riots...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you do differently to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any recommendations for things I simply must do or see in any of those places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/feeds/8434087704458666261/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/03/itinerary.html#comment-form' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/8434087704458666261'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/617223081670085997/posts/default/8434087704458666261'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://luketwomey.blogspot.com/2012/03/itinerary.html' title='The Itinerary'/><author><name>Luke</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/02660448933746069977</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-s-fLzN7u7mc/T2pkxcuSvSI/AAAAAAAAAU8/DRA3j0jPrgQ/s32/13408152_t_fb72c567b53776768508f34ce7ff2d5c.jpg'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-617223081670085997.post-3461518813741135271</id><published>2012-03-27T23:18:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-03-29T00:41:51.664+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='England'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Hello and Welcome!</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My name's Luke Twomey, and if you're reading this I've probably harassed (or bribed) you into visiting the site.

It's &lt;i&gt;too-me&lt;/i&gt; by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been working as a technical consultant in a software company for the past five years. This fully qualifies me to dispense the following invaluable advice regarding the problem you're no doubt having with your computer; turn it off and on again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years in a job is a relatively long time. I felt like I needed a change of direction. An opportunity arose to travel to Sydney to visit some friends. At its inception I intended to spend one month there. This evolved into spending a year travelling around Australia. This further evolved into spending a year backpacking Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand and New York. It hasn't yet got to the stage where I find myself trekking to the North Pole, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set up this blog for my own personal enjoyment, and sharing my experiences with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join me as I journey across the globe, experiencing soaring highs and crushing lows (hopefully less of the latter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/luketwomey" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7039/7009091949_13914c2dc1_o.png" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="1"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Check out my Flickr photostream which will be regularly updated with the amazing moments I capture along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
