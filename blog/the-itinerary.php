                    <p class="post-date">28th March 2012 15:51</p>
                    <p>Other than the order of the places I'm visiting, I'm trying to keep things as open as possible. This should afford me some spontaneity when it comes to deciding exactly what I'll be doing and when. The plan is:</p>

                    <p>Hong Kong -&gt; China -&gt; Vietnam -&gt; Cambodia -&gt; Laos -&gt; Thailand -&gt; Malaysia -&gt; Singapore -&gt; Australia -&gt; New Zealand -&gt; America (NY) -&gt; Home</p>

                    <p>The journey begins in Hong Kong:</p>

                        <figcaption>Erm, wow...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>I depart from Heathrow at 18:30 on the 16th April, arriving in Hong Kong International on the 17th April at 13:00 local time. That's an eleven and a half hour flight - I can't wait! Still, on the plus side I am flying first class with one of those fully flat bed things. OK I lied about that last bit.</p>

                    <p>I should be in Hong Kong for a couple of weeks, maybe a little less. I'm trying to give myself a decent amount of time in each place. A good friend suggested two weeks may be longer than I'd need, having been there himself, but that's OK. I'd rather be in that situation than feel like I hadn't seen enough of a place before I had to leave. Next up, China:</p>

                        <figcaption>Nanning, Guangxi...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>A fleeting visit, staying briefly in Nanning. I'll be travelling overland from Hong Kong, through mainland China to get to Vietnam:</p>

                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7248/7022535233_40b5804901.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Halong Bay...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>I'm expecting to arrive in Vietnam at the beginning of May, staying there around one month. Next up, Cambodia:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7193/6877873554_639e79a095.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Angkor Wat...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Now ain't that just a mighty fine lookin' temple? I am deliberately keeping all this very brief, as I'll be going into more detail on each country in the first blog post on arrival. After Cambodia is Laos:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7207/7023814289_0f19e88d18.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Vang Vieng...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Again I'll be here for approximately a month. From what I've read online these are decent lengths of time to get a good feel for each place. Thailand then follows:</p>

                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7201/6877731484_2d936d55e2.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Koh Chang (otherwise known as heaven if this photo is anything to go by)...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Slightly longer staying here - two months as opposed to one. I've lost count of the number of ladyboy comments I've had when I mention I'm going to this place! Next up, Malaysia:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6045/7023859583_de71fc6950.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Kuala Lumpur...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Yeah, I thought it looked pretty awesome too. One month for Malaysia before getting to Singapore:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7049/6877777702_e636decf43.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Singapore skyline...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Only a week here which apparently should be plenty of time. I then fly from Singapore on the 16th November, to Darwin.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6102/6877799484_90b9a1c710.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Kakadu National Park...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>One week here also, for the Kakadu National Park. I might get lost and have to live off the bush for the rest of my life though. All those years of watching Ray Mears should finally pay off. Next up is a flight to Alice Springs:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6240/7023910075_b71e4aeaa0.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Uluru...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>If you like rocks, really big rocks, here's the place to come. I'll be around for another week or so here before jumping on another plane to Cairns:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7255/7023919949_47a5b91683.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Great Barrier Reef...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>What a dive. Ba dum tishhh... I then make my way down the east coast - over the space of about a month - to Sydney:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6098/6877843492_ae727535d6.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Sydney Harbour...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>I'll be staying here with friends for a month or two - depending on how long they can stand the smell, and excessive nose picking. Next up, New Zealand:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7023962245_6bd7dbbeb5.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>New Zealand...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Starting off in Christchurch then making my way up to Auckland over the space of a month. Then flying from Auckland to New York:</p>

                        <figcaption>Times Square...</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Here for a couple of weeks before finally flying home to Croydon:</p>

                    <figure>

                    <p>*Sigh*</p>

                    <p>What would you do differently to me?</p>

                    <p>Do you have any recommendations for things I simply must do or see in any of those places?</p>
