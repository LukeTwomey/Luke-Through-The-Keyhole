                    <p>My name's Luke Twomey, and if you're reading this I've probably harassed (or bribed) you into visiting the site. Let me know if you've not yet received your life-size replacement Luke figurine.</p>
                    <p>I'll soon be embarking on a year long solo adventure around the world, which is the reason for starting the blog. I'd like to have things recorded to look back on, and it's a convenient way of keeping you guys updated too.</p>
                    <p>You can expect <strike>expert</strike> <strike>adequate</strike> somewhat competent posts sharing all my experiences (good or bad) while on the road. Photos will also play a large part, mostly to help conceal my poor writing skills.<p/>
                    <p>It would be nice to try and make this place feel like home, so please do leave comments/insults/hurtful remarks/general abuse lying around for me to see and have a chuckle (cry) over.</p>
                    <p>To get sent an email every time I add another pro-blogger quality update, enter your email address and click 'Subscribe'. There's also an RSS feed button if you like that kind of thing.</p>
                    <p>Thanks a lot for checking out the site. I'd love to hear from you, check out the 'Contact' section to find out how.</p>
